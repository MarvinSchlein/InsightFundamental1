While Gen Z is tech-savvy, their preference for in-person interaction could slow down or reverse the trend towards remote work, affecting companies that provide remote work solutions. However, it is important to consider that the pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote work, and this may outweigh Gen Z's preferences.
