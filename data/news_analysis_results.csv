This is primarily attributed to the company's second-quarter sales beating expectations, and the raising of its growth outlook. The market has reacted positively to these factors, as they indicate the company's resilience and ability to perform amidst challenges.

However, it is important to consider that the pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote work, and this may outweigh Gen Z's preferences.

The ISM nonmanufacturing index, which is more followed, is expected to be 51.5 versus 50.8 last month. The US service sector PMI highlights show that 5 out of 7 sectors saw rising business activity in July, up from 4 in June. The technology sector has experienced the fastest growth since June 2021 and has been the best-performing sector in 3 of the last 5 months. Financials have seen the second-strongest growth, with the fastest pace since December 2024. Although there was a slight decline in Healthcare and a continued contraction in Basic Materials, the overall trend is positive, indicating a bullish market.",

This is likely to have a negative impact on the job market, potentially leading to job losses in certain sectors. However, it's also important to note that the rise of AI could lead to the creation of new jobs in the tech sector, particularly in AI development and maintenance. This could offset some of the job losses in other areas. Nevertheless, the overall impact is likely to be negative in the short to medium term as the economy adjusts to these changes. This could potentially lead to increased unemployment rates and economic instability. The impact on the customer service sector could be particularly significant, given that five of the ten jobs identified as being most at risk are in this sector. This suggests that companies in this sector may need to start planning for a future where AI plays a larger role.",

This may cause short-term disruption as workers are displaced and need to retrain for new roles. However, in the long-term, this could lead to increased productivity and efficiency. The impact on the customer service sector could be significant, potentially leading to job losses and a need for retraining. The AI technology sector, on the other hand, could see a boost as demand for AI solutions increases.",

This could lead to job displacement and increased unemployment in the affected sectors. However, it could also potentially lead to cost savings for businesses as they would spend less on salaries and benefits. This might increase their profitability and positively impact their share price. However, the negative social implications of job losses could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential backlash against companies heavily involved in AI technology. Therefore, this news is bearish for the customer service and white-collar job markets, but potentially bullish for businesses investing in AI technology.",
We're adding to an industrial-focused stock that should be doing much better after earnings,We don't think the price action in DuPont reflects what we saw in the release and heard on the post-earnings conference call.,2025-08-05T15:05:43+00:00,Finance,"Industrial Sector, S&P 500",medium,5,medium,This situation is reminiscent of when 3M's stock price did not immediately reflect its positive earnings report in Q3 2019 but later saw a significant increase.,"The article suggests that DuPont's recent earnings report was more positive than the current price action indicates. This implies that the stock is undervalued and could be due for a price correction. The company's performance in the post-earnings conference call also seems to have been reassuring, which further supports this prediction. However, the market has not yet reacted to this, possibly due to other factors influencing investor sentiment or a lag in the market's response to the news. If the earnings report and conference call are indeed indicative of the company's future performance, we can expect the stock price to rise once the market adjusts to this information. This situation presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who believe in the company's prospects. However, as with any investment, there are risks involved, and this prediction should be considered in the context of a broader investment strategy.",

This discrepancy between the company's actual performance and its stock price could be due to various factors, including market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, or specific concerns about the company. However, if the company's financials are indeed strong and the market eventually recognizes this, there could be a significant upward adjustment in the stock price. As such, adding to a position in DuPont could potentially be a profitable move. The high confidence level is due to the clear discrepancy between the company's reported earnings and the market's reaction, which suggests a high likelihood of a future price correction.",

If the market corrects this oversight, it could lead to a significant increase in DuPont's stock price. This has happened in the past with other industrial sector stocks, such as 3M. It is also possible that other factors are suppressing the stock price, and the market has already taken the earnings report into account.

This is largely due to the knock-on effects of the ongoing tariffs. These tariffs are causing higher inflation and less employment, which is a bearish indicator for the economy. Higher inflation means that the cost of goods and services is increasing, which can lead to decreased consumer spending. The decrease in employment suggests that businesses are cutting back on their workforce, potentially due to the increased costs caused by the tariffs. This combination of factors is likely to lead to slower economic growth. This is a bearish indicator for the U.S. economy and the services sector, which is its biggest part.",

This stagnation is attributed to the knock-on effects of tariffs, which are essentially taxes on imported goods. Tariffs increase the cost of imports, leading to higher inflation. This in turn reduces consumer spending, a key driver of the services sector. Furthermore, the report indicates less employment, which could lead to lower consumer confidence and spending, further impacting the services sector. This combination of higher inflation and lower employment could potentially signal an economic slowdown. Therefore, this news is bearish for the U.S. economy and particularly for the services sector. The impact is rated high due to the significant role the services sector plays in the U.S. economy.",

Higher inflation can erode purchasing power, leading to decreased consumer spending, which is a key driver of the economy. Additionally, less employment can lead to lower consumer confidence and spending, further slowing economic growth. The services sector forms a large part of the U.S. economy, and its slowed growth can have significant ripple effects across other sectors and the broader economy. The impact of tariffs, which increase the cost of imported goods and can lead to trade imbalances, is clearly being felt in this sector. This gives us high confidence in a negative impact on the U.S. economy and the services sector specifically.",

However, in the long term, the negative effects of job displacement could outweigh the benefits, leading to a potential economic downturn. Additionally, if CEOs and other top-tier positions are at risk, this could lead to a reshuffling of leadership in many companies, potentially causing instability.

But U.S. trade deficits are still as big as ever.,High tariffs on China-made products drove U.S. imports from the world’s second-largest economy to a 16-year low in June — yet the dramatic shift hasn’t put a big dent in America’s overall trade deficit.,2025-08-05T18:38:00+00:00,Finance,"Import/Export, Manufacturing, Retail",medium,-5,high,"Similar to the 2008 financial crisis, high tariffs led to a decrease in imports.","The high tariffs imposed on China-made products have significantly impacted U.S. imports from the world's second-largest economy, driving it to a 16-year low in June. This suggests a weakened demand for Chinese goods, which could negatively affect sectors such as manufacturing and retail. Despite this dramatic shift, there has been no substantial reduction in America's overall trade deficit. This implies that the U.S. is still heavily reliant on imported goods, which could be from other countries. This could potentially lead to a shift in trade dynamics, with other countries filling the gap left by China. However, the continued large trade deficit indicates that the U.S. economy is still consuming more than it is producing, which is not a positive sign for long-term economic health. Therefore, this news is bearish with a high confidence level.",

This could be attributed to the fact that while imports from China have decreased, imports from other countries may have increased, keeping the overall trade deficit high. This situation is bearish for sectors such as manufacturing and retail, which rely heavily on imports for their operations. Furthermore, this could also negatively impact the import/export market. However, it's worth noting that the situation is fluid and dependent on future trade policy decisions, which could either exacerbate or alleviate the current situation.",

The high confidence in this analysis is due to the clear cause-and-effect relationship between high tariffs and decreased imports, as well as the historical precedent of similar situations leading to negative economic outcomes.",

Although overall sales were in line with analysts' predictions, the global average revenue per user fell short of expectations. This suggests that while Snap may be maintaining its user base, it is not monetizing them as effectively as anticipated. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as weaker ad sales, increased competition, or changes in user behavior. The drop in share price reflects investor concern about the company's ability to generate sustainable profits. In the tech sector, where user growth and monetization are key performance indicators, this news is likely to be taken negatively. Similar events in the past, like Twitter's Q2 2018 report, have also led to significant drops in share prices.

India ETF struggles to snap weekly losing streak after Trump’s tariff threat,"An ETF that tracks stocks in India is struggling to rebound from its recent losing streak, after President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on the country — and then threatened even steeper levies.",2025-08-05T21:22:00+00:00,Finance,"India ETFs, Emerging Markets",medium,-7,high,"Similar to when China faced tariffs from the US in 2018, the market reacted negatively.","The news of President Trump's 25% tariffs on India has a significant negative impact on Indian stocks, as represented by the struggle of the India ETF to rebound from its recent losing streak. The threat of even steeper levies adds to the bearish sentiment, as it creates an environment of uncertainty and fear. Tariffs generally increase the cost of imports and can lead to a decrease in trade, slowing economic growth. Given that the US is a major trade partner for India, these tariffs could have a significant impact on India's economy. Additionally, the tariffs could lead to a decrease in foreign investment in India, as investors may see the tariffs as a sign of increasing political and economic risk. This news is also likely to negatively affect other emerging markets, as it could lead to a general decrease in investor confidence in these markets.",

This current scenario is reminiscent of the US-China trade war, where the threat and imposition of tariffs led to significant drops in Chinese stocks and ETFs. Given the size of the Indian economy and the weight of the US as a trading partner, it is highly likely that these tariffs will have a substantial negative effect on Indian stocks and ETFs, hence the high confidence in the bearish impact rating.",

The ETF, which tracks stocks in India, is struggling to break its recent losing streak due to this development. Tariffs generally tend to increase the cost of imports, leading to inflation and a potential slowdown in economic growth. This could negatively affect the profitability of companies, thereby impacting their stock prices. The threat of even steeper levies adds to the uncertainty and could further dampen investor sentiment. This situation is similar to the impact of the US-China trade war on China-focused ETFs, which experienced significant declines due to increased trade tensions. The high confidence level in this analysis is due to the historically proven negative impact of tariffs on stock markets and the direct correlation between the India ETF and Indian stocks.",

This is because if the pilot is successful, it could potentially lead to a significant increase in the demand for weight loss drugs, as more people would be able to afford them under their health insurance. Furthermore, this could also lead to increased research and development in the field of weight loss drugs, leading to potential breakthroughs and even more demand. It's important to note that this is particularly significant given the high rates of obesity in the United States. As a result, companies that manufacture these drugs could see substantial increases in their revenue and profitability. Additionally, this move could potentially attract more investments into the pharmaceutical sector as a whole, as it indicates a favorable regulatory environment for drug manufacturers.",

US data worries starting to rear its ugly head again,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">There was quite a bit to digest with the US ISM services PMI print from yesterday <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/us-ism-non-manufacturing-pmi-501-versus-515-estimate-20250805/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

After the dismal jobs data at the end of last week, this will only add further concern to labour market conditions.

That being said, the directional bias is still very much intact.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">What does this mean?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As the ISM employment components track lower, it just means that we should expect to see further softness in the labour market in 2H 2025.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Besides employment, yesterday's report also saw the prices paid component rise from 67.5 in June to 69.9 in July.

This suggests a cautious approach by the central bank in stimulating the economy. This could be interpreted as a bearish signal for the UK bond market and banking sector as lower interest rates generally mean lower returns for lenders and investors in debt securities. However, the negative impact is considered to be moderate because the slow pace of rate cuts might also indicate that the Bank of England is confident about the strength of the UK economy and does not see the need for aggressive monetary easing. The central bank's cautious approach might also help to prevent potential financial abuses associated with low interest rates, such as excessive borrowing and risky investments. Therefore, while the slow pace of rate cuts by the Bank of England might have a negative impact on the UK bond market and banking sector, it could also contribute to the stability and sustainability of the UK economy in the long run.",

However, this move may result in lower returns for bond investors and reduced profitability for banks, as they will receive less interest on loans. This could negatively affect the financial sector in the short term. The fact that this news is expected suggests that the market has likely already priced in some of the impact of these rate cuts, which may limit the downside. Nonetheless, the overall impact is bearish due to the potential negative effects on the financial sector and bond market.",

Lower interest rates would allow these investors to afford hedging their dollar exposure, thus reducing the risk associated with currency fluctuations. As a result, they would be more inclined to invest in U.S. bonds. This increase in demand for U.S. bonds would likely drive up their prices, positively impacting the bond market. It's also important to note that this situation could lead to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the forex market, as more investors would need dollars to buy these bonds.

However, the largest railroad labor union is voicing concerns over the risks this merger may pose to jobs and safety. Mergers often lead to consolidation and efficiency measures, which could result in job losses. Additionally, the integration of two large rail networks could present operational and safety challenges, at least in the short term. These concerns, if realized, could negatively impact the stocks of both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The rail transportation sector as a whole may also be affected due to the potential disruption in freight services. This is reminiscent of the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger in 1996, which also sparked fears of job losses and safety issues.",

This could be due to lower than expected earnings, or perhaps future projections that are not as optimistic as investors would like. Marcus Lemonis, a well-known TV personality and executive chair of Beyond Inc., suggests that a partnership with certain retailers could be a potential solution to Opendoor's current problems. However, the success of such a partnership is uncertain and may be considered a long shot, which is why the confidence level is medium. If successful, this could potentially boost Opendoor's performance and stock price, but the risk involved makes the overall impact negative. In the past, similar situations have been observed where tech companies have experienced post-earnings slumps. But strategic partnerships have sometimes provided a way out of such predicaments.",

Additionally, the transition period following a merger can lead to safety issues as new procedures and protocols are implemented. The rail freight industry is a vital part of the transportation sector, thus any disruptions or negative impacts from this merger could potentially affect the broader market. Given the union leader's statements and historical trends, the impact of this news is bearish for the transportation and labor markets.",

However, the impact on the overall market may be limited due to other factors influencing oil prices, such as global demand and production levels in other countries. The sanctions could also have geopolitical implications, potentially escalating tensions between the US and Russia.

This is due to the fact that Social Security is a major source of income for a significant portion of the U.S. population. If this source of income becomes insolvent, it could lead to a decrease in consumer spending, which would negatively affect the overall economy. Furthermore, the news that the new Republican tax law will speed up Social Security’s insolvency increases the severity of this potential negative impact. The decrease in tax revenue could lead to a decrease in government spending, which could also negatively affect the economy.

The new Republican tax law, according to the agency's chief actuary, will accelerate Social Security's insolvency. This implies that there will be a significant reduction in the amount of funds available for retirees, which could lead to a decrease in consumer spending, negatively impacting the economy. A potential insolvency would also increase the burden on the government to find alternative ways to fund these social programs, possibly leading to increased taxes or cuts in other areas. The S&P 500, bond market and retirement services sector are likely to be directly affected by this news. Similar situations in the past, like the 2008 financial crisis, have shown that such threats to social security funds can cause significant market volatility and economic uncertainty.",

Furthermore, the news that the new Republican tax law could speed up the fund's insolvency adds to the bearish sentiment. This could lead to increased political uncertainty and potentially impact fiscal policy, both of which are factors that can negatively affect the equity market. Pension funds could also be affected as they may need to adjust their investment strategies to compensate for the potential loss of Social Security income for their members.

This trend is driven by the increasing number of single-person households, which is leading to a demand-supply mismatch. Home developers are currently overbuilding larger homes and underbuilding smaller ones. This imbalance is expected to correct itself as developers adjust their strategies to meet market demand. This shift could lead to increased activity in the real estate market, benefiting construction companies, home builders, and home furnishing companies. However, it's important to note that this trend could also lead to an oversupply of larger homes, potentially causing their prices to decline. Overall, this news is bullish for the real estate and related sectors.",

Developers who are overbuilding large homes may find themselves with an excess of unsold inventory, while those who are underbuilding small homes may struggle to meet demand. This could lead to a shake-up in the market, with potential opportunities for developers who can adapt to the changing landscape. Additionally, this could also affect related sectors such as home furnishings and appliances, as smaller homes require smaller and fewer items.

This increase in loans indicates that the company's risk profile has changed, as loans are considered risky assets. If these loans default, the company will face significant losses. Additionally, the high expectations for the AI lender could have led to overvaluation of the company's stock. When the earnings were released, it may have become apparent that the company was not meeting these high expectations, leading to a sell-off.

This could indicate that the company is taking on more risk, which can be a red flag for investors. Additionally, an increase in loan holdings can also mean an increase in potential defaults, which would negatively impact the company's bottom line. The fact that these loans are held on the balance sheet, rather than being sold off, could suggest that the company is having difficulty finding buyers for these loans.

However, the confidence level is medium as the reports are yet to be confirmed and are currently only being cited by Japanese media. Furthermore, Japanese officials have been stating that no deal or agreement has been signed yet, indicating a level of uncertainty surrounding the situation. Therefore, while the immediate impact is negative for the yen, the long-term effects will depend on the final decision regarding the tariff imposition.",

This is because investors often respond to lower-than-expected sales and rides by selling shares, leading to a decrease in share price. Furthermore, the ride-hailing market is highly competitive, with Lyft's main competitor, Uber, often being a benchmark for performance. Any perceived failure to keep up with Uber can also negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the better-than-expected demand metrics suggest that there is still strong consumer interest in Lyft's services, which could mitigate some of the negative impact. Still, given the mixed results and the competitive nature of the market, the impact is likely to be moderately bearish.",

While the improved demand metrics may provide some reassurance, the missed sales and ride targets are likely to have a more immediate impact on the company's stock price. This news is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment and could lead to a decrease in Lyft's share price in the short term.",

It could lead to increased production costs for companies who would either have to shift their manufacturing bases to the U.S. or pay the hefty tariffs. However, the fact that Nvidia and other chip stocks are not responding negatively to this threat suggests that investors might be shrugging off this threat, possibly due to the belief that it might not materialize or that the companies can absorb the impact. This could be due to the resilience demonstrated by these companies during the U.S.-China trade war. Nonetheless, the uncertainty surrounding the situation could lead to market volatility.",

It's likely to have a negative impact on the oil and gas market, as well as broader indices such as the S&P 500, due to the uncertainty it creates. This situation bears resemblance to the previous trade tensions between the US and China in 2018-2019, which led to market volatility.",

Imports also increased by 4.1% y/y, contrary to a predicted decrease of 1.0%. However, the trade balance is a surplus of USD 84.2bn, less than the expected USD 105bn. The decrease in exports to the US by 21.6% y/y and a year-to-date decrease of 12.6% y/y indicate a slowdown in trade between the two countries. The yuan's value remained steady despite the release of this data. While the overall figures are solid, the decrease in trade with the US and a lower than expected trade surplus could potentially have a negative impact on the Chinese economy, hence the negative impact score.",
Trump says billions of dollars are flowing into the US as reciprocal tariffs take effect,"<p>From the man himself:</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">""RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT!

As for the supposed billions flowing in (he's not wrong there as tariff revenue was $30 billion last month, marking a 242% increase compared to July last year), it's all going to be used to little by little try and make up for the ballooning US debt/deficit.

On one hand, the increase in tariff revenue, as evidenced by the $30 billion generated last month, could be seen as a positive factor for the US economy. However, it's important to note that these funds are expected to be used largely for offsetting the growing US debt and deficit, rather than for productive investments or stimulus measures. Additionally, the implementation of new tariffs could potentially escalate trade tensions and cause uncertainty in the markets. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and potentially lead to volatility in the stock, commodities, and forex markets. Furthermore, the mention of possible inflation suggests that the tariffs could lead to increased costs for consumers and businesses, which could further dampen economic activity and market performance.",

However, there is some positive news as these tariffs do not apply to pharmaceuticals and gold. This situation could have a negative impact on the Swiss market, particularly for industries not exempt from the tariffs. The potential for increased costs could lead to a decrease in trade between the US and Switzerland, potentially impacting the Swiss economy. However, the pharmaceutical and gold sectors may see less of an impact due to their exemption.",

This indicates a minor improvement in the trade balance, which is a positive sign for the French economy. The slight decrease in the deficit suggests that France's exports have grown at a faster rate than its imports. In fact, exports were seen up by 3.4% on the month while imports rose by 2.9%. This could be a sign of increased competitiveness of French goods in international markets, or a reflection of changes in domestic consumption patterns. However, the impact on the economy is likely to be minor given the small magnitude of the change. Furthermore, it's important to note that this is a single data point and doesn't necessarily indicate a trend. Therefore, while this news is somewhat positive, the overall impact is likely to be limited, hence the medium confidence level.",

The high demand for containers, driven by Chinese companies taking significant global market share, is causing a surge in prices. This is further supported by China's exports growing at a faster rate than its GDP, indicating a strong demand for goods. The shipping capacity is near saturation, which is driving freight charges higher. This is similar to supply-demand dynamics that drive up prices in any market. The uncertainty regarding tariffs also adds to the rush, as businesses seek to avoid potential costs. This environment creates a positive outlook for shipping companies as they can leverage the high demand and limited capacity to increase their revenues. However, it's important to note that this could lead to inflationary pressures in the global economy, which could be a concern for central banks and policymakers.",

Strong data is likely to trigger a more hawkish repricing, while weak data will reinforce bets for rate cuts and the probabilities for a third might increase further. </p><p>If the Fed continues with its dovish rhetoric despite stronger data just because of the NFP though, watch the 10 year Treasury yield as that will show you if the market is fearing a policy mistake. In fact, even if the Fed cuts, yields will likely rise (contrary to Trump's thinking) as the market will price in a higher inflation premium. </p>

This is due to the softer than expected Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which has led to some Fed members advocating for a cut. The market is now pricing 60 basis points of easing by year-end, up from 35 basis points before the NFP release. However, the article argues that the Fed may be overreacting to a single data point, and if the labour market is in fact healthy, a rate cut could lead to the Fed cutting into a rebounding economy, potentially leading to increased momentum. This could result in a policy mistake. The writer also suggests that if the Fed continues with its dovish rhetoric despite stronger data, it could lead to fears of a policy mistake, which could be reflected in the 10-year Treasury yield. Overall, this could lead to increased market volatility and uncertainty, particularly in the financial sector.",

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin's rally following the news of Trump's executive order allowing cryptocurrencies in retirement plans suggests a positive market sentiment towards regulatory acceptance of digital assets.

GBPUSD runs higher after rate cut. Buyers are more in control. Here are the reasons why.,"<p>The Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points today, but the decision revealed a more divided committee than expected. The final vote was 5–4 in favor of the cut, a more hawkish outcome than the 7–2 split anticipated by markets.</p><p>In a rare move, the MPC required a second round of voting to reach a decision. The initial vote saw four members favor a 25 bp cut, four vote for no change, and one member—BoE's Taylor—supporting a 50 bp cut. Taylor ultimately shifted his vote to 25 bps in the second round, giving the majority needed to implement the reduction.</p><p>Governor Andrew Bailey reiterated that while inflation and growth risks remain elevated, the rate path has become more uncertain. He emphasized that policy is still restrictive, and warned against cutting too quickly or too deeply. Bailey also pointed to softer-than-expected pay growth in May and signs that businesses are delaying investment decisions.</p><p>Deputy Governor Ramsden acknowledged that the persistence of UK inflation has surprised the MPC, noting the role of supply-side constraints and highlighting a wide 2–4% estimate range for the UK’s neutral rate. Other officials echoed concerns about weak activity growth, and downplayed the idea that rising borrowing costs reflect doubts about the BoE’s credibility.</p><p>Bailey dismissed recession fears, stating that his outlook hasn’t changed much since May, and clarified that the recent upward revision to 2025 GDP was driven by new data, not a shift in the committee’s broader economic view.</p><p>Technically, the GBPUSD extended its bullish momentum today, breaking decisively above the 38.2% retracement of the July 1–August 1 decline at 1.33865 and clearing a key swing area between 1.33607 and 1.3378 (highlighted by green circles on the chart). That zone, previously acting as resistance, has now turned into support following the Bank of England decision. The pair is also moving firmly above its 100-day moving average, currently at 1.33535, marking a significant shift in the near-term technical bias.</p><p>This breakout above multiple key levels — the 100-day MA, the swing area, and the 38.2% retracement — confirms a bullish technical reversal after a persistent downtrend since early July. The next major target lies at the 50% midpoint of the July–August move at 1.3463, which sits within a broader resistance zone between 1.3451 and 1.3467. A break and hold above this area would further strengthen the bullish outlook.</p><p>Taking a broader look at the daily chart below, the trend for the year before the recent decline from the July 1 high, has been to the upside. The price bottomed in January, and trended higher into July.  The more recent price decline below the 100-day moving average put that trend into question,  but the low price on the move to the downside since the July 1 high could not reach the 38.2% retracement of the longer term move up from January low.</p><p> That failure to extend below the 38.2% retracement kept the buyers in the long-term more in control and in play.

This partnership was likely a significant source of revenue and its end has negatively impacted the company's second-quarter results. The stock's decline is also attributed to the company's widening losses. This suggests that Krispy Kreme is struggling to maintain profitability, which is a major concern for investors. The stock was previously considered a meme-stock, meaning it was driven by retail investors and social media hype rather than its financial fundamentals. As the hype fades, the stock's value is returning to reflect the company's actual financial health, which appears to be poor.

The fact that the stock is tumbling suggests that investors are not confident in the company's ability to recover quickly or generate similar levels of revenue in the near future.

This can lead to lower corporate earnings, which can negatively impact stock prices. Furthermore, during periods of high inflation, central banks often raise interest rates to combat inflation, which can increase borrowing costs and further slow economic growth. This can also lead to a sell-off in the bond market as existing bonds become less attractive compared to new ones issued at higher interest rates. Finally, commodities can also be affected as they can become more expensive due to inflation, which can impact companies that rely on these commodities for their operations.",

This is a significant bearish signal, indicating that investors are losing confidence in the market, which could lead to a sell-off. However, market strategists suggest that this could be a contrarian signal. In other words, when sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, it could be an indication that the market is oversold and due for a rebound. This is because when most investors are bearish, it means that most of the selling has already occurred, and the market could be set for a rebound as buyers re-enter the market. However, the timing of such a rebound can be unpredictable, and it's also possible that the negative sentiment could lead to further declines before a rebound occurs. Therefore, while this news is bearish in the short term, it could potentially lead to bullish outcomes in the long term if it results in an oversold market bouncing back.",

This is because lower mortgage rates typically stimulate demand for home purchases, which can be beneficial for the real estate market. However, the current rate is significantly higher than the low of 2.65% in 2021, which means that monthly payments are still considerably higher than they were at that time. This could potentially deter some potential buyers and slow down the housing market. For banks and financial services, higher mortgage rates generally mean higher profits as they earn more interest on loans. Therefore, the decrease in rates could potentially impact their profitability. The fact that the rate is still higher than the 2021 low, however, means that they are still earning more than they were at that time, which could mitigate some of the impact. Overall, while the decrease is a positive development for potential home buyers, it could have negative implications for the real estate and banking sectors.",

Secondly, it can help Costco attract a wider demographic of shoppers who might be interested in the new product categories. As shoppers face more 'trade-off decisions', meaning they are becoming more selective and value-conscious, having a variety of products to choose from can give Costco a competitive edge. However, the success of this strategy is contingent on Costco's ability to effectively manage its inventory and supply chain, and to ensure that the new product assortments resonate with its customer base.",

Why Fortinet’s stock could see its worst drop on record,The cybersecurity company just shared that it’s 40% to 50% done with an upgrade cycle for firewalls — but some analysts think that limits future opportunities.,2025-08-07T18:52:00+00:00,Finance,"Cybersecurity, Tech",medium,-7,high,"Similar to when Symantec completed its major antivirus upgrade cycle in 2010, which resulted in a significant drop in its stock price.","Fortinet’s announcement that it is 40% to 50% done with an upgrade cycle for firewalls could be interpreted as a negative signal for future growth. This is because once the upgrade cycle is complete, there may be a decrease in demand for their products as customers will have the latest versions and won't need to upgrade for a while. This could lead to a slowdown in sales and hence affect the company's revenue and profitability. Additionally, the completion of the upgrade cycle might limit the company's future opportunities to generate additional revenue from the same customer base. In the past, similar situations have led to significant drops in stock prices for companies in the tech sector. Therefore, this news could potentially lead to a significant drop in Fortinet's stock price, making it a bearish signal for investors.",

This is because it signals that the company's growth may be limited in the future. When a company is in the midst of an upgrade cycle, it typically sees a boost in sales as customers upgrade to the latest product. However, once the cycle is completed, sales often decline as the market becomes saturated with the latest product. Therefore, being halfway through the cycle could indicate that Fortinet's growth may slow in the near future. This could result in a decrease in stock prices, as investors often look for companies with strong growth prospects.

Trade Desk’s stock tumbles after earnings.

This was primarily due to two reasons - firstly, the company's outlook did not offer any substantial upside, which is a key factor that investors look for to gauge a company's future profitability. Secondly, the company announced a change in the CFO position. Such a change in the financial leadership of a company often leads to uncertainty among investors, as it could signal potential financial instability or strategic shifts. Despite the company's results for the latest quarter beating expectations, these two factors seem to have overshadowed the positive performance, leading to a bearish sentiment among investors. The impact on the stock is likely to be negative in the short term, unless the company can quickly reassure investors about its future prospects and the reason for the CFO change.",

This suggests that while the short-term outlook may be bearish due to the aforementioned factors, the company's underlying fundamentals remain strong.

This move is likely to have a bearish impact on the gold market, as it could increase the cost of gold imports into the United States, potentially reducing demand. The tariffs could also have a significant impact on Switzerland, which is the world's largest gold refining center. Higher costs for gold imports could discourage U.S. businesses from sourcing their gold from Switzerland, potentially hurting the Swiss economy. Furthermore, if the tariffs lead to a decrease in the global demand for gold, this could depress global gold prices, negatively affecting gold producers and investors. This situation is similar to the 2002 steel tariffs imposed by the United States, which led to increased domestic prices and strained trade relations. Therefore, this news is expected to have a bearish impact on the gold market, with a high level of confidence.",

The big story in bullion was the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on strategic large gold bars (1 kg and 100 oz) — the formats COMEX accepts for delivery. The move is expected to disrupt the Exchange for Physical mechanism linking London’s unallocated market to New York’s deliverable futures, forcing shorts to close or roll positions and potentially triggering a funding squeeze in London’s bullion banking system. By constraining deliverable supply, it accelerates Basel III-driven pressure on bullion banks to hold more physical metal and limits the LBMA’s ability to rehypothecate bars, denting Switzerland’s refining dominance and boosting COMEX’s role in global price discovery. More details in the somewhat posts.</p><p>In geopolitics, Israel said it will retake Gaza City, escalating the conflict with Hamas.</p>
                            This article was written by Eamonn Sheridan at investinglive.com.",2025-08-08T03:48:26+00:00,Finance,"Gold, Forex, Japanese Equities",medium,-2,high,"Similar to past instances of trade disputes causing market volatility, such as the US-China trade war.","The news article is primarily focused on the imposition of US tariffs on large gold bars, which is expected to disrupt the bullion market funding and strengthen COMEX’s role in price discovery. This could lead to a decline in gold prices, making it bearish for the gold market. Moreover, the Japanese equities market responded positively to the US pledge to correct a tariff order and refund excess duties, which is bullish for the Japanese equities market. The forex market also saw some movement with the yen weakening against the dollar. However, the Bank of Japan's division over future rate hikes adds uncertainty to the market. Overall, while there are some positive aspects, the disruption in the gold market and uncertainty in forex make the overall impact slightly bearish.",
"Gold spot prices hold steady despite surge in COMEX futures, what's next?","<p class=""text-align-justify"">The surprise tariffs is clearly catching the market off guard as we see a surge now in COMEX futures as compared to their counterpart in London. Essentially with the tariffs now, it just means that gold will be more expensive in the US market as opposed to overseas markets.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">And that is leading to the uncommon price discrepancy we're seeing with regards to the price futures between the COMEX and LME. In a typical scenario, the prices should only differ due to contract specifications - which are backed by the physical delivery of the underlying metal.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">But before any gold is transported to the US from London, it has to go through refineries in Switzerland to be recast. That is due to COMEX requiring different bar sizing for their contracts. Then only is the gold transported to the US for physical delivery. Hence, that is where the tariffs come in and making it more expensive for gold prices in the US now. That as well as Switzerland also refines roughly 90% of gold sourced from industrial mines.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">So, what's next for gold prices if this is the case?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The thing to note is that markets were not quite prepared for this tariffs announcement. The gold rush into the US that we saw back in January and February didn't quite continue and now markets are left with their heads in their hands for the most part.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">In turn, that could lead to a potential funding stress that UBS warns <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/ubs-has-warned-that-us-tariffs-on-large-gold-bars-could-spark-disruption-20250808/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. It's a good read if you haven't gotten to it earlier to understand what the potential ramifications of the tariffs could be.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">But at least for now, gold lease rates have yet to surge amid the latest developments. The 1-month forward is roughly at -0.18% as opposed to the start of the year eruption to a whopping 5%. (h/t @ zerohedge)</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">This suggests that there is good amount of supply of gold in London for the time being.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">How does this impact the spot price?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">For now, prices are steady with not too much movement. Gold is hovering around $3,392 even as COMEX futures are surging. I reckon traders are taking their time to evaluate the whole situation and we haven't seen any major alarm just yet.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">But at the end of it all, it comes down to what the US is actually trying to do here. Is this just a technicality gone wrong or is this intentional?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The Trump administration will have to clarify this ruling letter, even if it was issued by the Customs Border Protection agency. At this point, only Trump's words should be taken as confirmation really. But if the letter does hold, then what exactly is the US trying to do here?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">For one, it might be a play to try and bump up Treasury reserves. In other words, a basic case of revaluing gold held by the US Treasury and solidifying a better position for themselves. If so, we could see spot prices explode further in keeping with the tailwinds that have underpinned gold all through the year.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">I mean, it wouldn't be too farfetched to say that this move is done to drive up demand amid choking the so-called gold ""supply chain"". This would lead to prices moving up as paper shorts get burned. And once the market settles down and reprice everything at a higher level, the US then gets to work with a more golden benchmark that sees it trump above everyone else.</p>

"‘Stagflation is coming to the U.S.,’ says this economist. Here’s what it means for the dollar, bonds and stocks.",The greenback faces a Wile E. Coyote moment says Savvas Savouri,2025-08-08T10:57:00+00:00,Finance,"Currency, Bonds, Stocks",medium,-7,medium,"Similar to the stagflation period of the 1970s in the United States, where the economy experienced stagnant growth, high inflation and high unemployment.","The prediction of stagflation coming to the U.S. implies a period of stagnant economic growth combined with high inflation and unemployment. This scenario is generally bearish for the dollar, bonds, and stocks. In such an environment, the value of the dollar could decrease due to inflation, making imports more expensive and potentially exacerbating inflation further. For bonds, inflation erodes the real value of the fixed interest payments that bondholders receive. Therefore, in a stagflation environment, bond prices might decline as investors demand higher yields to compensate for the increased inflation risk. Stocks could also be negatively affected as companies' costs rise due to inflation, squeezing profit margins. Lower corporate profits can lead to a decline in stock prices. However, the confidence level is set to medium as economic predictions can be uncertain and depend on a variety of factors not mentioned in the article.",

Savvas Savouri's prediction of a 'Wile E. Coyote' moment for the greenback implies a sharp fall after a period of suspended reality. This could result in a weaker dollar, which might lead to higher import costs and thus, increased inflation. In the bond market, stagflation is generally negative as it erodes the value of fixed income payments. For stocks, the impact could be mixed. While some sectors may benefit from inflation (such as commodities), others may suffer due to higher input costs and lower consumer spending. Overall, the impact of this news is bearish for the markets mentioned. The confidence level is high given Savouri's reputation as an economist and the logic behind the prediction.",
India reportedly pauses plans to buy US arms as trade dispute rages on,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">Reuters is reporting on the matter and the sources cited also say that India's defence minister has cancelled his planned visit to the US. This comes as India is now pausing plans to purchase US arms, which would've included Boeing P-8I aircrafts, Stryker vehicles, and Javelin missiles.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">It is said that India is now waiting on more clarity on US tariffs and trade developments before thinking about resuming arms purchase discussions. On trying to find a compromise, India is reported to be open to reducing oil imports from Russia as part of any tariffs settlement. But for now, we'll have to wait and see if there is any common ground to work with after things have gone south rather quickly in the past few weeks.</p>

The suspension of the deal not only directly impacts these companies' potential revenues, but also signals a deterioration in US-India trade relations. India's willingness to reduce oil imports from Russia as part of a tariff settlement also suggests that the dispute is affecting a broader range of sectors. Furthermore, the cancellation of the Indian defence minister's visit to the US indicates a serious escalation of the situation. While it's still uncertain how this will play out, the immediate impact is negative for US defense and aerospace companies. Additionally, this development could potentially affect the broader market if it leads to increased trade tensions between the US and India.",

Furthermore, this increase could also lead to a rise in sponsorship deals, advertising, and broadcasting rights, providing a boost to the media and entertainment industry. However, it's important to note that such events typically have a modest impact on the broader market.

Furthermore, Amazon's entry into this sector could potentially disrupt the existing market dynamics and put pressure on the revenues and growth prospects of Trade Desk. However, it is also important to note that Trade Desk's CEO has stated that Amazon's competition is limited because it competes against its own marketing customers.

On one hand, tariffs can be seen as a positive as they protect domestic industries from foreign competition, potentially boosting profits for these companies and, by extension, their stock prices. On the other hand, tariffs can also escalate into trade wars, which can have a negative impact on the global economy. This can lead to a decrease in international trade and potentially a recession, which would negatively impact the stock market.

Tariffs, in theory, are expected to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. However, they also tend to increase the cost of goods, which could lead to inflation and a decrease in consumer spending. Moreover, they can lead to trade wars, as other countries may retaliate with their own tariffs. This could result in a slowdown in global trade, which would negatively affect the stock market. The President's comparison of a potential tariff knockdown to a Great Depression-style economic situation also adds to the bearish sentiment.

The primary reason is that such controversies often create an atmosphere of uncertainty which is not well received by the market. However, the impact is projected to be mild and not severe. This is because the CEO has already addressed the issue, which may help to assuage some of the concerns. Furthermore, the operations and financial performance of Intel are not directly tied to the CEO's previous roles.

This move suggests that the buyer perceives the dip as a temporary setback and anticipates a recovery or growth in the stock's value. The fact that the buyer is adding back half of the 80 shares sold around $190 in May indicates a renewed confidence in the stock's performance. Additionally, the upgrade of the rating to 1, typically the highest rating in investment analysis, signifies a strong positive outlook. This could potentially stimulate other investors to follow suit, thus driving up the demand and price of the stock. However, as with all investments, this move carries risk as the future performance of the stock is uncertain and dependent on various factors including the overall performance of the restaurant industry and the broader market trends.",

Despite the analysts' rush to defend the pharmaceutical giant, investors are not yet convinced. This could be due to a variety of factors. Firstly, investors may be skeptical of the analysts' positive outlook due to recent market volatility, especially in the pharmaceutical sector. Secondly, investors may be wary of potential regulatory changes that could impact Eli Lilly's profitability. Lastly, the company may be facing internal challenges that are causing investor skepticism. In any case, the lack of investor confidence despite positive analyst outlook is a bearish signal. However, the extent of the bearish impact is mitigated by the fact that this is a common occurrence in the stock market, where investor sentiment often lags behind analyst predictions. Therefore, while this news is bearish, it is not significantly so.",

Furthermore, this move could also lead to an increase in stock prices due to the sudden influx of funds, creating a bubble that could burst and lead to a market crash. Therefore, while the intention to improve the financial health of the Social Security program is commendable, the method proposed is fraught with potential issues and risks.",

Firstly, the stock market is inherently volatile and unpredictable, making it a risky place to invest funds that are meant to provide a stable source of income for retirees.

Additionally, the government's involvement in the stock market could lead to conflicts of interest and political influence over market decisions. Furthermore, this proposal could potentially delay the necessary reforms needed to ensure the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. Instead of looking for quick fixes, policymakers should focus on sustainable solutions to the Social Security funding problem, such as increasing payroll taxes or raising the retirement age.",

The recommendation for Apple to make a splashy acquisition and pay up for top AI hires suggests that the company needs to take drastic steps to catch up. However, such a move could also be risky and costly. It's worth noting that Apple's brand and customer loyalty are significantly stronger than Blackberry's were, which could mitigate some of the potential negative impact. Nevertheless, Apple's perceived lack of innovation in AI is a concern that could impact investor confidence and the company's future growth prospects.",

This could increase consumer spending, particularly in the retail sector, as people have more disposable income. However, the confidence level is only medium as it is still just an idea and not a confirmed policy. Moreover, the impact of such rebates on the economy can be varied. In similar situations in the past, such as the tax rebates issued by the George W. Bush administration in 2001 and 2008, the impact on the economy was positive but short-lived. Therefore, while this news could boost consumer spending and the retail sector in the short term, it may not have a long-term positive effect on the US economy.",

This could provide a boost to these sectors, particularly if the checks are distributed at a time when consumer confidence is otherwise low. However, the confidence in this analysis is only medium, as it is not yet clear whether this proposal will be implemented. Furthermore, the overall impact on the economy may be limited if the checks are funded by increased tariffs, which could have a negative impact on other sectors of the economy, particularly those involved in international trade.",

EURUSD technicals:The EURUSD is consolidating near the week's highs buy above 50% midpoint,"<p>The EURUSD began its upside move last Friday after finding support at the 100-day moving average, which served as a strong base for buyers. That momentum extended into this week, with the pair breaking above the 200-hour moving average and the 38.2% retracement (1.1558) of the decline from the July high. The bullish move continued past the 50% midpoint at 1.16098, confirming increased control by buyers.</p><p>On Thursday, the pair peaked just shy of 1.1700, a natural resistance level, before pulling back to retest the 50% retracement.

Michigan Governor Whitmer tells Trump tariffs are hurting Michigan autos,"<p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met privately with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday to deliver a message: his tariffs were damaging the very automotive industry he has pledged to protect. The conversation marked Whitmer’s third meeting with Trump at the White House since he took office in January.</p><p>AP carried the report. In brief:</p><p>In the closed-door discussion, Whitmer warned that the economic fallout from the tariffs could be severe for Michigan, a state whose support was pivotal in Trump’s 2024 election victory. She also pressed for federal aid to support recovery efforts after a recent ice storm and urged the administration to delay planned changes to Medicaid that could affect residents’ healthcare coverage.</p><p>According to people familiar with the meeting, Trump offered no specific commitments in response. Those sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private exchange, said the president listened but gave no indication he would reconsider his trade policy.</p>

US Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, who dissented from the FOMC’s July decision to hold rates steady, said in a Saturday speech that she favours rate cuts at each of the remaining 2025 meetings — in September, October, and December. She argued that weakness in the US labour market outweighs the risk of renewed inflation.</p><p>From China, July CPI and PPI data were released (details in earlier posts). The biggest headline of the day came in early Asia hours, with the Financial Times reporting that Nvidia and AMD have agreed to hand over 15% of their China chip sales revenue to the US government in exchange for export licences. While this might have been expected to weigh on the stocks and NASDAQ futures, both saw modest gains after the news.</p><p>Elsewhere, news flow was extremely light. In the US, a defence official said the military is preparing for a possible order from President Trump to activate part of the D.C. National Guard for deployment in Washington. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, dampening liquidity. The US dollar was slightly softer, with major FX pairs trading in narrow ranges.</p><p class=""western"">

US inflation data to set the tone for markets this week,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">The US CPI report is the be all and end all for markets in trading this week. After <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/us-data-worries-starting-to-rear-its-ugly-head-again-20250806/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">the recent string of poor data</a>, traders have gone on to price in a September rate cut as Fed policymakers also start to turn more dovishly. But what happens if inflation runs hotter than expected?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Stagflation risks are on the rise and this is now becoming the key buzzword that markets are turning to.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Looking at the numbers, headline inflation in July is expected to see a monthly increase of 0.2% (lower than 0.3% in June). However, the annual figure is still estimated to rise to 2.8% (up from 2.7% previously).</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As for core inflation, the monthly figure is expected to increase by 0.3% (up from 0.2% in June) with the year-on-year estimate seen at 3.0% (up from 2.9% previously).</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The core figures are obviously the more important element but the devil will still be in the details with the report. The key thing will be to watch out for any further tariffs passthrough from businesses to consumers. If there is more evidence of that, it will be a bit of an issue for the Fed.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">But at this stage, I can see them pulling out a leaf out of the old playbook. The whole ""inflation is transitory"" framing a few years ago comes to mind and I imagine policymakers using that again to sell rate cuts towards the end of this year. The thinking would be that tariffs inflation would just bump up prices temporarily.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">So, we'll have to look forward to. But whatever the case is, stickier inflation numbers will just make the Fed's job a whole lot tougher. And it will also keep markets on their toes before September.</p>

What are the main events for today?,"<p>It's going to be kind of a synthetic Sunday today as we don't have anything on the agenda. The main event of the week is the US CPI report tomorrow, so we might see the market either consolidating ahead of the release or keep following the trend set by the dovish Fedspeak.</p><p>Over the weekend, we had Fed's Bowman supporting three rate cuts by year-end and she even added that more weakness in the labour market could call for a bigger rate cut. The recent Fedspeak suggests that a rate cut in September might be unavoidable, we might need very hot inflation data to change their mind (and of course a good NFP report in September). </p><p>They don't have the guts to look through some labour market weakness at this point. Therefore, the CPI tomorrow might need to come in higher than expected to change the market pricing and then it will be a matter of focusing on Fedspeak and Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium to see whether they are still on board for a cut in September.</p>

Taiwan says that tariff negotiations with US are still ongoing,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">As a reminder, Taiwan was slapped with 20% tariffs in the latest twist to the tariffs saga. But they are reaffirming that negotiations are still ongoing, with the goal being to ""seek a better and more reasonable tariff rate"".</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">It's the same case for many countries, even those that have reportedly struck a ""deal"" with the US before the 1 August deadline. These deals seem to be framework agreements at best as is the case for the EU, UK, Japan, and also China to some degree. They are mainly just a pact to deal temporarily with lower tariffs while supposedly trying to negotiate for better terms.</p>

"Gold eases to start the week, traders await US tariffs clarification","<p class=""text-align-justify"">Gold futures, more specifically COMEX contracts, surged at the end of last week as the US customs agency is said to have marked the precious metal as being subject to tariffs. The spot market was much calmer as noted <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/gold-spot-prices-hold-steady-despite-surge-in-comex-futures-whats-next-20250808/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, as traders were also waiting for the White House to make a mention about it.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">But as we get into the new week, there's still no clarity on the matter. So, it's still a bit of a limbo situation. When it comes to tariffs, Trump has the final say. And if we don't hear anything, it's hard to take other sources as confirmation really.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">For now, traders are still assessing the situation. But even if the tariffs are confirmed, it really comes down to what the intention from the US really is as mentioned in the linked post.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Going back to gold prices today, we are seeing COMEX futures fall back from the surge higher on Friday. The spread between COMEX futures and LME futures have narrowed back to around $60, roughly similar to back before the jump. For some context, the spike higher on Friday saw the spread hit over $120 at the peak.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">And as the situation cools, so are gold prices at the spot level.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The near-term chart shows buyers have lost the more bullish bias, with price action dipping back below the 100-hour moving average (red line). The 1% drop today now puts the focus back on the 200-hour moving average (blue line) at around $3,352 currently. Hold that line and the near-term bias stays more neutral with buyers keeping some relevance. But break below that, and the near-term bias switches back to being more bearish in favouring sellers.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">While we continue to wait on the White House to say something, if they ever do, the big picture still shows gold largely consolidating since May. And we're yet to really break that stride over the last few months. So, the next significant move will come on a break of this consolidative phase for the most part.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">To the upside, gold will have to first contest the May, June, and July highs around $3,435-50 before thinking about another shot at the $3,500 mark. As for the downside, the 100-day moving average (red line) at $3,292 currently is a big, big one to watch. Gold has not firmly broken that mark since October 2023. So, if we do get a notable correction, that might be the key trigger for one.</p>

"Technical Analysis: What technical levels are driving the EURUSD, USDJPY & GBPUSD","<p>The USD is at the highs to start the day vs most of the major currencies, but still relatively little changed. In the video above, I take a technical look at the EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD and outline the bias, the targets and the risks for each.  </p><p>This week, the key events begin early Tuesday  in the US with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy decision at 12:30 A.M. ET (Aug 12), where the cash rate is expected to decline to 3.60% from 3.85%. This will be accompanied by the RBA’s Monetary Policy Statement, rate statement, and press conference. Australia’s data flow continues later in the week with the Wage Price Index on Tue, Aug 12 at 9:30 P.m. ET, forecast to rise 0.8% q/q, followed by labor market figures on Wed, Aug 13 at 9:30 p.m. ET, with employment change expected at 25.3K (vs 2.0K last month) and the unemployment rate declining to  4.2% from 4.3%.</p><p>In the U.S., the focus this week is on inflation, spending, and sentiment. July CPI is released Tue, Aug 12 at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline CPI forecast at +0.2% m/m (core +0.3%) and the y/y rate rising to 2.8%(from 2.7%). Producer prices follow on Thu, Aug 14 at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline PPI expected to rise by 0.2% and core PPI also up 0.2%. At the same time, weekly jobless claims are projected at 225K (vs 226K last week). Retail sales are out Fri, Aug 15 at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline sales seen up 0.5% m/m (vs 0.6% last) and core +0.3% (vs 0.5%). The week wraps with the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment on Fri at 10:00 a.m. ET, expected at 61.9, with inflation expectations at 4.5%.</p><p>From the U.K., the key release is GDP m/m on Thu, Aug 14 at 2:00 a.m. ET, forecast to rebound 0.2% in July after a 0.1% decline in June, offering an early read on third-quarter growth momentum.</p><p>Over the weekend, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, who holds a permanent vote on the FOMC and a dove, signaled support for three rate cuts by the end of 2025, citing a sharp deterioration in the U.S. labor market. Speaking at a bankers’ conference in Colorado Springs, she pointed to significant downward revisions in recent nonfarm payrolls — May revised from 144,000 to 19,000 (-125,000) and June from 147,000 to 14,000 (-133,000) — as evidence of weakening economic momentum. Bowman argued that the apparent slowdown in growth and a less dynamic labor market outweigh the risks of higher inflation, making it appropriate to move from a moderately restrictive stance toward neutral. She expects to back a cut at each of the Fed’s remaining meetings this year — September 16–17, October 28–29, and December 9–10 — aligning with recent dovish signals from other Fed officials including Daly, Waller, Williams, and Kashkari.</p><p>Also over the weekend , Nvidia and AMD have reached an unprecedented agreement with the Trump administration to give the U.S. government 15% of revenues from certain chip sales in China in exchange for export licences. Under the deal, Nvidia will share 15% of revenue from H20 chip sales, while AMD will provide the same percentage from MI308 chip sales to China. The arrangement, confirmed by a U.S. official, was a condition for licences granted last week, shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Trump. The administration has not yet determined how the funds will be used. Export control experts note that no U.S. company has previously agreed to share revenues to secure export approval, marking this as a first-of-its-kind arrangement aligned with the administration’s broader strategy of tying market access to measures that generate U.S. jobs and revenue. Wow. Who would have thought the US goverment would have a revenue sharing deal with US companies? Has a dam just been broken? </p><p>Later this week Trump and Putin will meet in Alaska to try and end the war in Ukraine. The proposal for Ukraine to cede land to Russia is a contentious point of discussion. Ukraine President Zelenskiy said over the weekend that Ukraine could not violate its constitution on the territorial issues, adding that ""Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupiers.""</p><p>Shares of the two companies are down in premarket trading. Nvidia shares are trained down $1.01 or 0.55% at $181.67. Meanwhile AMD shares are down  $2.90 or -1.68% at $169.86.</p><ul><li>Dow industrial average is up 126 point</li><li>S&P index is up 13.55 points</li><li>NASDAQ index is up 38 points</li></ul><p>in the US debt market yields are down modestly with the longer end lower:</p><ul><li>2-year yield 3.760%, +0.2 basis points</li><li>5-year yield 3.820%, -0.7 basis points</li><li>10 year yield 4.269%, -1.4 basis points</li><li>30 year yield 4.831%, -2.3 basis points</li></ul>

EURUSD technicals: EURUSD falls to the next key support target,"<p>EURUSD has pushed to fresh session lows, pressing against a key technical pivot — the 50% retracement of the drop from the July 1 high at 1.16098. Earlier in the U.S. session, the pair slipped under its 100-hour moving average at 1.16312 (blue line), flipping the near-term bias to the downside. For sellers, that MA now serves as close risk, and staying below it keeps the bearish tone intact.</p><p>A decisive break under 1.16098 would clear the way for a run toward the 200-hour MA at 1.15648. Until then, this midpoint is the battleground. In recent sessions, EURUSD has been capped between that 1.16098 level and Wednesday’s high at 1.1698, making today’s test all the more significant. Sellers have the upper hand — now it’s about whether they can punch through and extend the momentum.</p><p>I spoke to these levels in the <a href=""https://investinglive.com/technical-analysis/technical-analysis-what-technical-levels-are-driving-the-eurusd-usdjpy-gbpusd-20250811/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">video </a>from earlier today. </p>

USDCAD technicals: USDCAD moved above the 100 day MA. It did not go well.,"<p>USDCAD pushed higher in today’s session, breaking above the 200-hour MA at 1.37817 and the 100-day MA at 1.37876. From a technical perspective, those breaks should have been meaningful and set the stage for additional upside momentum. Instead, the rally quickly lost steam, and the price slipped back below both levels, leaving traders to question whether the move was simply overextended.</p><p>For USD sellers, CAD buyers, or risk-focused traders, the 100-day MA now serves as a clear level to lean against for short setups. A sustained move lower from here opens the door to the 38.2% retracement at 1.37626, with the 100-hour MA at 1.3754 providing the next downside target.</p><p>If price moves below both those levels, focus shifts to the 50% retracement, which would be the next logical support zone. </p><p>Recall that last week  — the pair broke below the 50% retracement, but the momentum failed, and USDCAD based out before reversing higher. </p><p>Traders should be mindful of a similar outcome here. Failed breaks are something traders should be wary about technically.  Nevertheless, if the buyers return and push above the 100 day MA, I would not mess with the short side (it represents the risk and bias defining level) </p>

Trump tariff revenues reached $29.6B in July. Has it peaked?,"<p>The Trump tariff revenues reached $29.6B in July which was a  billion or two more than the $28B collected in June. Tariff revenues rose steadily from $17.4 billion in April to $23.9 billion in May, before climbing to $28 billion in June. </p><p>At $29.6B running rate (call it $30B per month), that would reach $360B for the year.  That is more collected than ever, but it is not the $700B that Commerce Sec. Lutnick touted on Sunday news shows back at the end of July.  </p><p>See: <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/lutnick-no-more-extensions-of-tariffs-past-august-1-700b-in-tariffs-will-be-collected-20250727/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">https://investinglive.com/news/lutnick-no-more-extensions-of-tariffs-past-august-1-700b-in-tariffs-will-be-collected-20250727/</a></p><p>Pinochio?</p><p>Goldman over the weekend, estimated that:</p><ul><li>64% is being paid by US companies</li><li>22% by US consumers</li><li>14% by others(? - maybe by foreign company lowering their prices)</li></ul><p>Can that mix continue keeping inflation lower?</p><p>It can, and if other inflation moves lower, the door could open for the Fed to cut rates going forward. Fed's Bowman sees three cuts between now and the end of the year. </p><p>For companies to eat the 64%, they will need to find it somewhere. Increasing efficiency, cutting payroll are some ways.  For the consumer, it cost more for imported goods, but will services prices go down and soften the blow? Of course it does not impact all goods. According to a Federal Reserve analysis, imports account for about 11% of total U.S. consumer spending, and this figure has been stable for over a decade.</p><p>BTW... My wife and I wanted something for lunch on Saturday while we did some errands.  So I suggested McDonalds as time was limited (we do not go there often).  For a two cheeseburger meal (which we split) it came to $12.30.  Wow. </p><p>The average tariff rate moved down after August 1 suggesting the US may have we peaked in tariff revenue?</p><p>Anyway, getting to $700B might be difficult. We will see..  </p>

AUDUSD technicals: AUDUSD consolidates around MA levels,"<p>The AUDUSD is trading near its session lows, but the day’s range is only 34 pips — a sign of restrained price action ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate decision in the new trading day. The RBA is widely expected to cut rates by 25 bps to 3.60% at 12:30 AM ET, following a February cut from 4.35% to 4.10% and a second cut in May to 3.85%. Last month, the central bank surprised by holding rates steady, signaling that timing rather than direction was the priority.</p><p>Market expectations are firmly in place for this move — a Reuters poll showed unanimous agreement for a cut, with most economists also expecting one more reduction before year-end. Softer inflation and labor market data are helping pave the way. CPI has eased toward the lower bound of the RBA’s 2–3% target, with Q2 headline inflation falling to 2.1% y/y, its lowest since March 2021 and below the 2.2% forecast. June jobs growth added just 2,000 jobs versus expectations of around 20,000, marking the weakest gain since October 2024, while unemployment ticked up to 4.3% from 4.1%.</p><p>Technically, the pair is holding just under its 200-bar MA (0.6528) and 100-bar MA (0.6513) on the 4-hour chart. These averages sit above the midpoint of the broad range in place since April 23, which spans from the low at 0.63546 to the high at 0.6625 (midpoint 0.6489). Today’s low of 0.6502 leaves price roughly 13 pips above that midpoint. Staying below the 100-bar MA favors sellers, while a move back above the 200-bar MA would hand the advantage to buyers.</p><p>On the downside, a break below the 0.6489 midpoint would expose a swing area near 0.64519, the 100-day MA at 0.64375, and the 200-day MA at 0.6389. Given weaker domestic data and the anticipated rate cut, the fundamental backdrop leans bearish for AUDUSD — but with U.S. rate expectations also shifting lower, the impact may be muted. In this type of sideways, range-bound environment, using the moving averages as bias-defining barometers may be the cleaner play for traders.</p>

The biggest gain was versus the NZD (0.34%). The greenback rose by 0.18% versus the AUD ahead of its interest rate decision in the new trading day. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in reaction to lower inflation (2.1% year) and some weaker jobs data.</p><p>Tomorrow the US CPI will be released at 8:30 AM ET with the month-to-month expected to rise by 0.2% and the core up 0.3%.

Shelter accounts for 34% of the overall CPI weight - by far the greatest influence in the figure. </p><p>If goods inflation can remains elatively tame, it will give the dovish Fed officials more leeway to call for rate cut rates with the understanding that the tariff effect continues to remain subdued and the focus should shift to the risk from weaker employment (after the poor US jobs report at the beginning of the month). </p><p>The calendar was void of any data today.  From Washington, Trump announced that China would get another reprieve from increased tariffs for 90 days. </p><p>Trump spoke of progress being made on peace negotitions between Ukraine and Russia as he prepares to meet with Russia's Putin later in the week.

"Trump taps EJ Antoni to head BLS, sparking concerns over partisanship and expertise","<p>Trump taps EJ Antoni to head BLS, sparking concerns over partisanship and expertise
</p><p>President Trump has nominated EJ Antoni, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following Trump's dismissal of the previous commissioner over job report revisions. </p><p>The pick has drawn sharp criticism, much of it centred on Antoni’s reputation as a hyper-partisan figure. </p><p>While some of that pushback comes from across the political aisle, not all of it does.
A more substantive concern is that Antoni is an economist rather than a statistician, raising questions over whether he has the technical background to run an agency whose work hinges on statistical rigour. </p><p>For markets, the key worry is the potential impact on the perceived reliability and integrity of the BLS’s data — including closely watched employment and inflation figures.</p>

Pantheon Macroeconomic says CPI data is consistent with 0.23% increase in core PCE,"<p>Pantheon Macroeconomics sees the CPI data consistent with a 0.23% increase in the core PCE to be released later this month. The PPI data will add to that you when it is  released tomorrow.   Their view is that the July CPI won't significantly shift market expectations around Fed easing; sentiment for a rate cut remains intact.</p><p>That is not too bad. It is still above the 2% in target. Meanwhile Wall Street Journal's tomorrow's is saying that the:</p><ul><li> ""September rate cut could of been derailed by CPI print today, and the July CPI wasn't a ""no inflation"" reading, but it wasn't hot enough to stop a September cut.""</li></ul><p>In other observations, coming off the major revisions in the US employment, the chatter is increasingly focused on ""trusting the data"" versus ""THE data"".  If it is garbage in/garbage - or even the perception - what good is it?</p><p>Suddenly, the data which was admittedly prescribed by Fed chair Powell as the gold standard, is now something less.</p><p>President Trump nominated E.J. Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist and vocal critic of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), to lead the agency after firing Commissioner Erika McEntarfer earlier this month. McEntarfer, a respected career economist confirmed in 2024, was dismissed following BLS data revisions showing May and June job growth was 258,000 lower than initially reported — a move that drew bipartisan outrage. </p><p>The nomination reflects Trump’s push to install allies at the helm of agencies producing key economic data on jobs, wages, and prices.</p>

Fed Schmid: Supports a patient approach and changing the Fed's policy rate,"<ul><li><p>Retaining a modestly restrictive policy stance is considered appropriate for the time being.</p></li><li><p>Supports a “patient approach” on changing the Fed’s policy rate.</p></li><li><p>Policy rate is not far from neutral, but inflation remains too high.</p></li><li><p>Tariffs’ limited effect on inflation is a reason to keep policy on hold, not to cut rates.</p></li><li><p>Tariffs’ likely muted effect on inflation is a sign that policy is appropriately calibrated.</p></li><li><p>No possibility of knowing the full effect of tariffs on prices over the next few months.</p></li><li><p>Will adjust views if there are signs of significant weakening in demand growth.</p></li></ul><p>Tilts more to the Hawkish tilt
The stance is firmly on holding rates steady, with inflation still viewed as too high and tariffs’ muted inflation impact reinforcing the case against cuts. The policy rate is seen near neutral, but the preference is for a patient, modestly restrictive approach until clearer signs of demand weakness emerge.

EURUSD technicals: EURUSD  runs to a new high. Based at the 100 hour MA and pressed higher,"<p>The EURUSD is pressing higher in the aftermath of a volatile, whipsaw reaction to the US CPI report. The initial response to the data was to the upside, but that move quickly ran into resistance as sellers leaned against a downward-sloping trendline in the short-term chart and the 61.8% retracement of the recent swing move. The rejection from that zone saw a sharp pullback, taking the pair down toward the 50% midpoint of the range at 1.16098. Momentum on the downside slowed, and the post-CPI low ultimately found support at 1.1617.</p><p>From there, buyers re-entered, gradually regaining control. As price pushed higher, the 100-hour moving average—currently at 1.16435—became the key pivot point. The break above that level was decisive, shifting the intraday bias back in favor of the bulls. Importantly, the market then used that 100-hour MA as a technical springboard, holding above it on subsequent dips and accelerating to new session highs.</p><p>The rally has since tested the top end of recent trading ranges, with today’s high at 1.1696 coming within a fraction of last week’s peak at 1.1698. That 1.1700 handle is now a clear line in the sand for traders. A sustained break above this level would signal a breakout and open the door for an extension toward the next major upside target—the July 24 high at 1.1787.</p><p>For now, short-term momentum favors the upside, but the market is not without nearby resistance. Sellers may still attempt to defend the 1.1700 barrier on the first test, especially given the over-100-pip rebound from the session low. On the downside, support levels to watch include the</p><ul><li>Broken 61.8% retracement at 1.16615.</li><li> 100-hour MA at 1.16435,</li></ul><p>Staying above the 100 hour moving averages essential if the buyers are to maintain control.  A failure and the buyers will likely be disappointed.</p><p>In sum, the technical picture has improved for the EURUSD after shaking off an initial pullback. The battle now centers on whether the bulls can push through 1.1700 and set their sights on 1.1787, or whether sellers can once again cap the rally at familiar resistance.</p>

Markets quiet down after the US CPI report yesterday,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">There was plenty of action after the US CPI report <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/us-cpi-for-july-02-versus-02-expected-core-03-versus-03-expected-20250812/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> yesterday but broader markets are seen taking a bit of a breather after the hustle and bustle overnight. The only real mover on the day is in crypto as Ethereum shoots up above $4,600 to four-year highs. Other than that, we're seeing light changes all around across other asset classes.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">In FX, major currencies are muted after the dollar fell yesterday with traders now more or less fully pricing in a 25 bps rate cut for September. Fed funds futures also show ~60 bps of rate cuts priced in by year-end currently. Here's a snapshot of dollar pairs going into the session ahead:</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As seen above, the changes are light with narrow ranges prevailing for the most part. Are we already switching back to the summer lull in just less than a day?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Elsewhere, equities are also looking fairly muted today. S&P 500 futures are flattish following a push to fresh record highs in Wall Street yesterday. There's no follow up just yet in the new day but buyers remain firmly in control as tech shares continue to stay buoyed. The AI boom continues to run its course.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">So, what can we make of the US CPI report yesterday?</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">On the front of it, the numbers might seem pretty alright and more or less in line with expectations. Core monthly inflation came in at 0.322%, matching estimates but is at the highest since January. Meanwhile, core annual inflation was seen at 3.059% - just a fraction higher than estimates and borderline causing the rounding to the 3.1% reading we're seeing.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The breakdown though was more interesting and telling. The bottom line is that we're still yet to see material tariffs passthrough. There is some evidence but nothing overwhelming to suggest a major impact yet for the time being. So, the can gets kicked down the road for yet another month.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Of note, core goods inflation underwhelmed with a 0.21% m/m reading, meaning it was little changed compared to June's 0.20% m/m reading. That's not particularly strong evidence of any major uptick in price pressures there.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">And according to MNI, their calculation of median core goods inflation across 56 items even softened to 0.28% m/m after the 0.44% m/m reading in June. The pace of the increase is still a strong one with it having averaged 0.0% m/m in 2024 and 0.06% m/m in Q1 2025. However, the moderation in July points to a lack of material evidence of acceleration in tariffs passthrough on inflation.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Now, most analysts are expecting there to be a stronger uptick here in the fall months i.e. autumn. But for now at least, we still have to wait for another month to see if inflation data will prove to be scarier than it is made to be for the Fed.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The reaction among Fed policymakers are more mixed though with Kansas City Fed president Schmid saying <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/fed-schmid-supports-a-patient-approach-and-changing-the-feds-policy-rate-20250812/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">he will dissent to a rate cut</a>. Meanwhile, Fed governor nominee Miran of course says that <a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/fed-nominee-miran-on-cnbc-pleased-the-bls-number-is-well-behaved-20250812/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">there is no evidence at all of any tariffs passthrough</a> and that the inflation numbers are ""well behaved"". Then again, he is nominated by Trump for the position so you'd expect that kind of political bias in his remarks.</p>

The price yesterday settled at $63.17.</p><p>Technically, The price has moved below the 100-hour MA (blue line on the chart above) at $64.78. That level - and the swing area between $63.61 and $65.27 - I consider the risk and bias defining level in the short term. Stay below that area, keeps the sellers in firm control in the short term at least. Moving back above that area, would disappoint the sellers on the technical break lower. </p>

USDCAD technicals: The USDCAD is mired in a narrow range. Traders await the next shove,"<p>The USDCAD remains trapped in a narrow trading range, with the market awaiting a clear directional push. Momentum has stalled, and traders are looking for a decisive break to define the next leg.</p><p>On the downside, support is clearly defined at the 100-bar moving average on the 4-hour chart, currently near 1.37414. A break and hold below this level would weaken the short-term structure and open the door for deeper corrective moves.</p><p>On the topside, the 100-day moving average has been breached on a couple of occasions this week but has more recently acted as a firm ceiling. Sellers have leaned against this level, reinforcing a stronger bearish bias. However, a clean re-break above the 100-day moving average would be a notable bullish signal and could spark a shift in momentum back toward the upside.</p><p>The accompanying video outlines these technical levels in detail and explains the reasoning behind each, along with what traders should watch for in the sessions ahead.</p>

EURUSD Technicals: Watching the 1.1700 area as close support for buyers in the short term,"<p>The EURUSD dipped in the early U.S. session, briefly breaking below support at 1.1698–1.1703. The decline extended to 1.1692 before rebounding back above the 1.1703 mark. The recovery pushed the pair to a session high of 1.1723, but momentum has since faded, and the price has rotated lower again.</p><p>I continue to view 1.1698–1.1703 as a pivotal short-term level.

USD/JPY slid to lows near 146.40. The move reflected broad US dollar weakness amid rising expectations for a September Federal Reserve rate cut, with the widely anticipated 25bp move joined by increased talk of a possible 50bp reduction. Selling pressure on USD/JPY was compounded by remarks from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who not only criticised the Fed but also took aim at the Bank of Japan, calling it “behind the curve” and urging it to raise rates to control inflation.</p><p>Earlier, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee struck a cautious note on September easing. While open to the idea of a cut, he stressed that the FOMC needs to see several months of favourable inflation before acting. He pointed to persistent services price pressures in the latest CPI and said the Committee was not yet convinced the labour market is deteriorating despite some signs of softness.</p><p>In Australia, labour force data was the main event. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.2% in July from 4.3% in June, while full-time employment posted its strongest monthly gain in 17 months. AUD/USD jumped as market pricing for a September RBA rate cut eased to around 30% from 40% before the release.</p><p>Elsewhere, GBP/USD touched a three-week high, supported by diverging Fed–BoE policy expectations, while the crypto complex extended gains, with Bitcoin and Ethereum both rallying on a mix of Fed easing hopes and strong inflows.</p><p class=""western"">Asia-Pac

Crude Oil Technical Analysis –  Trump-Putin summit in focus,"<p>Fundamental
Overview</p><p>Crude oil has been on a
downward trend ever since the softer than expected NFP report at the beginning
of August triggered some growth concerns. That was then followed by the OPEC+
increase in oil production, although it was already expected. </p><p>The focus then switched to the
easing in concerns on harsher US sanctions on Russia as expectations on a
possible ceasefire have been building leading up to the Trump-Putin summit in
Alaska tomorrow. </p><p>The focus on higher supply
and lower demand has been weighing on the market despite the upcoming Fed rate
cuts. </p><p>Although we don’t know how
the summit is going to go, positive developments could mark the bottom on a “sell
the fact” scenario with the focus then switching to the rate cuts which will be
positive for demand.</p><p>Crude Oil
Technical Analysis – Daily Timeframe</p><p>On the daily chart, we can
see that crude oil is now trading below the key 64.00 <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-support-and-resistance-20220405/"">support</a> zone. The sellers will likely continue to pile
in around these levels with a defined risk above the support now turned
resistance to position for a drop into the 55.00 handle next. The buyers, on
the other hand, will want to see the price rising back above the 64.00 resistance
to invalidate the bearish setup and position for a rally into the 72.00
resistance.  </p><p>Crude Oil Technical
Analysis – 4 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 4 hour chart, we can
see that we have a minor downward <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/technical-analysis-trendlines-20220406/"">trendline</a>
defining the bearish momentum. The sellers might split their orders to pile in
both at the trendline and the 64.00 resistance. The buyers, on the other hand,
will target upside breaks to position for a rallies into new highs.</p><p>Crude Oil Technical
Analysis – 1 hour Timeframe</p><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s
not much else we can add here as the sellers will look for a rejections around
the trendline and the resistance, while the buyers will look for upside
breakouts.  The red lines define the <a href=""https://investinglive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/"">average daily range</a> for today.</p><p>Upcoming
Catalysts</p><p><a href=""https://investinglive.com/EconomicCalendar"">Today</a> we get the US PPI and the US Jobless
Claims figures. Tomorrow, we conclude the week with the US Retail Sales, the

"AUDUSD is down sharply today completing ""the lap"" from the low to the high and back down","<p>The AUDUSD is down sharply in trading today. The currency pair is down -0.81% from yesterday's close. Technically the bias has shifted from more bullish to more bearish on the move lower. </p><p>Looking at the hourly chart, the initial move was to the upside taking out the high price from yesterday in the process at 0.6562. The high price reached 0.6567 before rotating to the downside. Buyers started to shift the two sellers below 0.65407 swing level.</p><p>The PPI data added to the negative sentiment sending the price through the 100-hour moving average at 0.6523, and then followed by the 200-hour moving average at 0.6503..</p><p>The low price got within a few pips of the low from Tuesday's trade at 0.6481. The low price for the day reached 0.6483 just 2pips above that level. That is close enough for completing ""the lap"" that took the price from the low on Tuesday, to the high today and all the back down to the low.  </p><p>Buyers are leaning against the low. If broken, and opens the door for further selling.</p><p>For traders looking for more downside after the sharp move lower, it would take a move back above the broken 38.2% retracement at 0.64966 and the 200-hour moving averages 0.6508 to tilt the bias higher - at least in the short term. Absent that, and the sellers are still holding the best hand and control. </p>

"China July home prices fall, even as Beijing eases suburban purchase restrictions","<p>Recapping the data from earlier. </p><p>China’s new home prices fell for a second month in July, down 0.3% from June, though the decline narrowed slightly in major cities as more local governments introduced homebuying incentives. Reuters calculations from National Bureau of Statistics data show 60 of 70 surveyed cities recorded month-on-month drops, compared with the same pace in June.</p><p>On an annual basis, prices fell 2.8%, easing from June’s 3.2% drop. If there is a glimmer of not so bad news its that the year-on-year decline narrowed modestly across all city tiers. Policymakers view stabilising the property market — once a quarter of China’s economic activity — as crucial to meeting the “around 5%” GDP growth target amid domestic weakness and external pressures.</p><p>Despite multiple rounds of demand-boosting measures and liquidity support for developers, a sustained recovery remains elusive. Recent moves include allowing greater use of housing provident funds, offering purchase subsidies, and, in Beijing’s case, scrapping suburban buying curbs in August while keeping restrictions within the fifth ring road.</p><p>-</p><p>Related, further official data on Friday showed China’s property investment fell 12.0% year-on-year in January–July, a deeper drop than the 11.2% decline recorded in the first half of the year.</p>

"The USD is higher to start the US trading day for August 14, 2025","<p>The USD is lower to start the US trading session. Japan had higher GDP released overnight which has helped their currency (weakened the USD). The EURUSD has trended to the upside with little in the way of corrections in trading today. That move took the price above the 100 hour MA at 1.1662 and back toward resistance ""around"" 1.1700.  The price earlier this week extended above that area only to fail. The GBPUSD is higher too (only modestly), but is running into initial resistance at 1.3561. There is a swing area between 1.3576 to 1.35918 that stalled the rallies on Wednesday and Thursday, before rotating back to the downside.  </p><p>There is a full slate of economic data to be released at 8:30 AM ET including the NY Fed Manufacturing for August (0.00 vs 5.50 last month), Import (0.0% vs 0.1% last month) and export prices (+0.1% vs 0.5% last month) for the month of July, and Retail Sales (est 0.5% est vs 0.6% last month). The Canada Manufacturing Sales data for June will also be released at 0.4% est vs -0.9% last month).</p><p>Fed's Goolsbee will be speaking later today. He spoke yesterday as well and was neutral.Yesterday, the PPI was released and defined estimats around 0.26% to 0.27% increase in the core PCE later this month.  </p><p>The Fed is still expected to cut by 25 basis points (94%) .  Before the data, there was a 6% chance of a 50 bp cut. The estimates for cuts later in the year have moved lower as well.  </p><p>Of course the Trump-Putin Summit on Ukraine will take place at 3 PM ET. The primary agenda is to get to a 2nd face to face meeting with Zelenskiy. A ceasefire in the process would also be a positive.  The two leaders also could speak on arms control between the US and Russia.  The negative is the meeting could result in no further meetings due to unreasonable demands,  and increased sanctions imposed on Russia intended to inflict the most pain. We know that the US shot an arrow across the bow, by increasing tariffs on India for importing Russian oil. Other such sanctions that would cripple their lifeline (oil) would be likely (amongst others).</p><p>A lot around the markets shows US stocks mixed with the Dow higher, the S&P modestly higher (it closed at a record) and the Nasdaq little changed</p><ul><li>Dow up 277 points</li><li>S&P up 10.46 points</li><li>Nasdaq -4.44 points</li></ul><p>IN the US debt market, the yields are little changed:</p><ul><li>2-year yield 3.733%, -0.5 basis points</li><li>5-year yield 3.822%, +0.1 basis points</li><li>10-year yield 4.295%, +0.3 basis points</li><li>30-year yield 4.88%, +0.6 basis points</li></ul>

Pres. Trump the plane lands in Alaska ahead of the meeting with Russians Putin,"<p>President Trump’s plane has landed in Alaska ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled to begin at 3 PM ET — about 40 minutes from now. Reports indicate the talks could last for hours, meaning any outcomes are unlikely before the U.S. market close.</p><p>Objective: The primary goal is to find a solution to the Russia–Ukraine war, though discussions may also cover de-escalation of tensions and economic sanctions. Pres. Trump has also indicated that he would want to see a cease-fire announced ahead of the next summit between Ukraine and Zelenskiy.</p><p>Format change: Instead of a one-on-one, the meeting will be a three-on-three, including Secretary of State Rubio and U.S. envoy Witkoff, both of whom met with Putin last week to lay the groundwork.</p><p>Aftermath: Following the meeting, President Trump is scheduled to call Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and EU officials. Trump has reiterated his belief that Ukraine and Russia will ultimately need to strike a deal for peace — likely involving the ceding of some territory to Russia, an idea Ukraine has rejected.</p><p>Crude oil is moving lower on peace hopes that Russian sanctions would be eased. The price of crude oil is down $-1.20 at $62.75.</p>

A slower Monday set to greet European traders to start the week,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">The meeting in Alaska was a bit of a dud to say the least as it didn't achieve much. Now, we'll see Ukraine president Zelensky head to Washington again to meet with US president Trump. This time around though, he will be accompanied by European leaders so as to not get ambushed as he did back in February.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">There's hopeful optimism but given how talks are being done separately in this manner, you wouldn't blame me for being skeptical that some deal can be done without Ukraine being involved. All eyes will be on what Trump will sell with regards to the security guarantees. So, we'll see.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As markets return from the weekend, the mood music is more sanguine to start the new week. Major currencies aren't up to much with the dollar keeping steadier. That comes after some slight declines on Friday with US retail sales for July more or less matching estimates <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/us-retail-sales-for-july-05-vs-05-est-ex-auto-03-vs-03-est-20250815/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. And that is despite markets scaling back on Fed rate cut expectations amid inflation concerns.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Chicago Fed president Goolsbee sounded a bit of a warning shot at the end of last week <a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/fed-goolsbee-there-is-a-note-of-unease-from-the-last-cpi-and-ppi-data-20250815/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">In other markets, US futures are also holding little changed and marginally higher as we look to the session ahead. The big retailers will be reporting earnings this week, so that will be one to watch for any tariffs impact on prices and consumer appetite. Target and Walmart will be the two big names on the list.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">So far on the day, cryptocurrencies are the ones on the move with Ethereum continuing to take a step back after failing to get past $4,800 last week. That is seeing price fall to $4,320 and dropping below both its key hourly moving averages for the first time in two weeks. The winds are changing again.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Coming up today, there won't be anything significant on the data front in European trading. However, things should pick up with the RBNZ meeting, Fed minutes, UK CPI, and PMI data all set to feature in the days ahead. That before we get to the Jackson Hole symposium at the tail end of the week.</p>

What are the main events for today?,"<p>Today it's going to be kind of a synthetic Sunday as we don't have anything on the agenda. The only notable event is the Trump-Zelensky meeting in Washington where there will also be a few European leaders participating. Not sure if markets care about the Russia-Ukraine war though. The biggest moves have been seen just in specific markets like the Russian stock market, the ruble and maybe crude oil. </p><p>The focus this week is going to be on the Jackson Hole Symposium where Fed Chair Powell is going to deliver his speech on Friday. Traders will be attentive to any tiny signal on what's next for monetary policy and whether Powell opens up for a rate cut in September. Most likely though, he won't pre-commit to anything and will just reiterate that they will decide on the totality of the data.</p>

GBPUSD lower but stalls near 100 hour MA/retracement level. Buyers/sellers battle it out.,"<p>The GBPUSD moved lower in trading today, slipping below two important technical levels — the 100-hour moving average at 1.3543 and the 61.8% retracement of the July 1 high to the August 1 low at 1.35397.</p><p>Although these breaks were significant, the downside momentum has remained limited. The pair extended to a low of 1.35301 before rebounding modestly, with the current price hovering near 1.3539.</p><p>For sellers, the strategy is clear: hold below the 100-hour moving average and look for a new low. If bearish momentum develops, the next critical target comes at the 200-hour moving average, currently at 1.3477.</p><p>Buyers, however, will be eyeing a recovery if the price can climb back above 1.3561. A stronger push through the swing area between 1.3576 and 1.3592 would be required to build sustained upside momentum.</p><p>It is worth noting that last week’s highs stalled within that same swing zone up to 1.3592, reinforcing its importance and keeping sellers in control for now despite the lack of strong follow-through to the downside. Buyers and sellers are battling it out.</p>

Bloomberg: Trump administration looking to take a 10% stake in Intel,"<p>Bloomberg is reporting that the Trump administration is looking to take a 10% stake in Intel. This is a follow-up to the late last week's story of an investment by the US. The grants given by the Chips Act would be converted to equity.  </p><p>The deal would not add net new money to Intel's coffers, but can imagine that ""The Dealmaker' may have threatened taking the money that was pledged away. Trump has publically called the Chips Act a disaster (or something to that effect). </p><p>Shares of Intel are currently trading down $0.61 or -2.63% at $23.92. At the high price last on Friday, the price extended up to $25.65. The high price today was at $24.90. </p><p>The high for the year was reached back in February at $27.55. The low was in April at $17.70.</p><p>Technically the news last week pushed the price away from its 100 and 200 day moving averages at $21.26 and $21.67 respectively. That tilts the short-term bias to the upside but there is more work to do to increase the bullish bias after the sharp move lower in 2024 that took the price down from a high of $51.28.</p>

And that is mostly to avoid calls by Russia in wanting Ukraine to downsize its military as part of any peace agreement in the future.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Adding to that, the sources say that a package of security guarantees would also build on the work of the so-called coalition of the willing from Europe.

The one exception was a modest decline versus the JPY.  Looking at the percentage changes of the US dollar shows:</p><ul><li>EUR +0.13%</li><li>JPY -0.15%</li><li>GBP +0.11%</li><li>CHF +0.05%</li><li>CAD +0.46%</li><li>AUD +0.59%</li><li>NZD +0.47%</li></ul><p>The NZD was one of the weakest ahead of the expected interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The CAD was also weaker after Canada's July CPI rose 0.3% MoM (in line with estimates) while the YoY rate slowed to 1.7% (vs. 1.8% expected, 1.9% prior), showing a softer inflation profile. The Bank of Canada’s core measures were steady to slightly lower, with median at 3.1%, trim at 3.0%, and common at 2.6%. Gasoline prices fell 16.1% YoY, shelter costs climbed 3.0% (driven by rent +5.1%), and grocery prices accelerated to +3.4% YoY, led by spikes in coffee, confectionery, and fruit. Regionally, Newfoundland & Labrador saw the sharpest acceleration, boosted by electricity costs. The softer CPI has pushed USDCAD higher.</p><p>US July housing data was mixed with housing starts jumping to 1.428m (vs. 1.290m expected, 1.358m prior revised), showing stronger-than-expected construction activity. Building permits, meanwhile, came in softer at 1.354m (vs. 1.386m expected, 1.393m prior). While the data adds to a string of stronger U.S. releases, it is unlikely to shift near-term focus away from NFP and CPI. However, the resilience in housing suggests that if the Fed cuts rates too soon, it risks fueling additional economic strength and sustaining inflationary pressures.</p><p>In geopolitical news, Trump said that Europe is eager to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, noting that France, Germany, and the UK even want boots on the ground in Ukraine. He emphasized that while the U.S. will not put troops on the ground, Washington is helping to set up a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. Trump added that the relationship with Putin only matters if it leads to results, and that Zelensky must also show flexibility, including the possibility of giving up territory. He reiterated that Ukraine should not be in NATO and will not be part of NATO, but said some form of security assurances could be offered outside of NATO. He observed that Putin and Zelensky are “getting along a little bit better,” though it’s possible Putin may not want to strike a deal—something that will become clearer in the next couple of weeks. Trump also stressed that Russia is a powerful military nation, and maintained that having a warm relationship with Putin is a good thing.</p><ul><li><p>Geopolitical risk remains high – Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine may need to give up territory and won’t join NATO signals potential fractures in Western unity, raising uncertainty over the war’s outcome.</p></li><li><p>Security guarantees unclear – While Trump floated “some form of security” for Ukraine outside NATO, the vagueness adds to uncertainty, especially for European allies who want firmer commitments.</p></li><li><p>Europe vs. U.S. tension – With France, Germany, and the UK reportedly open to sending troops, but the U.S. firmly ruling it out, divisions could emerge within the Western alliance.</p></li><li><p>Russia leverage reinforced – Trump’s acknowledgment of Russia as a “powerful military nation” and his framing of a warm relationship with Putin as “a good thing” could embolden Moscow, impacting both negotiations and market perceptions of risk.</p></li><li><p>Market angle – Heightened geopolitical uncertainty could support safe-haven flows into USD, CHF, JPY, and gold, while weighing on European assets given the direct regional exposure.</p></li></ul><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke on business news this morning said he believes a meeting between Putin and Zelensky is likely, noting that both sides seem ready to bring the conflict to an end. He described Monday as an optimistic and positive day. On policy matters, Bessent confirmed plans to raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil and said the U.S. is pushing back globally against digital services taxes. He added that Nvidia will now need a license for any new chip sales to China, signaling tighter export controls. Bessent also mentioned that meetings with Federal Reserve candidates are scheduled for right before and right after Labor Day. On the economy, he noted that much of the recent increase in PPI inflation came from investment services implying that the rise in the US stocks increased the PPI.</p><p>As mentioned, the new trading day, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely expected to cut its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.0%, with 28 of 30 economists in a Reuters poll forecasting the move. The decision comes as annual inflation slowed to 2.7% in the June quarter, within the RBNZ’s target range, while unemployment rose to 5.2%, the highest since late 2020. Economists view the cut as part of the final phase of the easing cycle, with forecasts pointing to an additional reduction to 2.75% in early 2026. Markets have already priced in the move, so attention will shift to the RBNZ’s tone and forward guidance, which will determine whether policy easing stalls here or if further cuts remain on the table amid concerns over tariffs, inflation, and jobs. </p><p>Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve will announce or meeting minutes from the July meeting. Two members of the FOMC voted for an interest rate cut. On Friday, Fed chair Powell will speak at the Jackson Hole Summit</p><p>US stocks saw the growth and momentum stocks move sharply to the downside.:</p><ul><li>Dow industrial average rose 0.02%</li><li>S&P index fell -0.59%</li><li>NASDAQ index fell -1.46%.</li><li>Russell 2000 fell -0.78%.</li></ul><p>So the rotation out of stocks headed overseas to Europe where the major indices closed higher with France closing at a new record. Spain and Italy closed at their highest levels in 17/18 years.</p><p>In the US debt market, yields move lower despite the dollars rise:</p><ul><li>2-year yield 3.754%, -1.9 basis points</li><li>5-year yield 3.827%, -2.8 basis points.</li><li>10-year yield 4.310%, -2.9 basis points</li><li>30-year yield 4.911%, -3.1 basis points</li></ul>

PBOC is expected to set the USD/CNY reference rate at 7.1897 – Reuters estimate,"<p>People's Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.</p><p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a ""band,"" around a central reference rate, or ""midpoint."" It's currently at +/- 2%.</p><p>How the process works:</p><ul type=""disc""><li>Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day's trading.</li><li>The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.</li><li>Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency's value.</li></ul>

What are analysts expecting from today's UK CPI data,"<p>Below is a quick look at what various market participants are expecting from today's UK CPI data.</p><p>Knowing the consensus is important, but knowing where the minimum and maximum expectations are, as well as any herding around a particular side, can be very helpful for risk event traders like me.</p><p>For the Headline YY CPI, consensus is clustered around 3.7%, with a minimum expectation of 3.5% and a maximum of 3.9%. Already a slight skew towards a higher print for today.</p><p>For the Core YY CPI, consensus is also sitting at around 3.7%, with a minimum of 3.4% and a maximum of 3.9%.</p><p>As for the Services CPI YY, consensus is clustered around 4.8%, with a minimum of 4.7% and a maximum of 5.0%, with a slight skew towards a higher print.</p><p>As always, any prints that fall below the minimum or above the maximum will receive a lot of attention from participants.</p><p>Interest rate expectations for the September meeting is at 94% probability of a hold, with October at 78% probability of a hold. There are only 13 basis points of easing priced into year-end.</p><p>This means a big surprise beat likely sees markets price out the likelihood of another cut completely. The size of miss it would take to persuade markets of an October cut will need to be big.</p>

Latest UK inflation data puts the BOE in an even tougher spot,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">On the surface, the numbers already don't look all too encouraging as seen <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/uk-july-cpi-38-vs-37-yy-expected-20250820/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Traders were already not expecting a rate cut next month but this may well see market pricing shift towards no rate cuts at all for the year soon enough.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The immediate details show that there are some volatile factors leading to the increase in price pressures in July. ONS notes that transport prices in particular were a big driver of that, largely due to a surge in airfares and hotels. On that, the UK stats office argues that it could be possibly influenced by the timing of school summer holidays.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">""Returning European flights were during the school term in 2024, whereas returning European flights were during the school holidays in 2025, which may have made these flights more expensive.""</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Even so, there are other concerning details in the report to be wary of. In core terms, annual services inflation crept back up to 5.0% - up from 4.7% in June. And food price inflation moved up to 4.9% in July, up from 4.5% in June, to its highest since February last year:</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">If markets are looking for a reason to scale back on rate cut expectations for this year, there's quite a bit in the report here to point to.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">And if anything else, all of this will continue to bolster the idea of stagflation risks for the BOE towards the end of the year.</p>

What else to expect from the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week?,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">Goldman Sachs notes that typically Fed chair Powell's address will be the most market-moving event of the Jackson Hole Symposium. And they expect a return to flexible inflation targeting as part of the Fed's main strategy moving forward. But as things stand, market players will be mainly eyeing for commentary on the US economic outlook and details of the Fed's monetary policy framework review.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As an aside, the firm argues that it'd be worth watching out for policy hints from side interviews. That especially with regards to surprise signals from ECB or BOE officials on inflation and/or policy divergence.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">As for market reaction, Goldman Sachs says that off-schedule remarks do have the potential to move markets - especially FX - if they do stand out from the status quo.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Just for some added context here, ECB president Lagarde and BOE governor Bailey will also be in attendance at Jackson Hole this year. They are both due to appear on a panel on Saturday.</p>

The USD is little changed to kickstart the US trading session as Fed Powell awaited,"<p>The US dollar is little changed versus the three major currency pairs. In the video above I will outline the key technical levels in play given the recent price action as the midpoint of the week and the speech from Fed chair Powell on Friday looms large in the future. The NZDUSD moved sharply lower after eight more dovish RBNZ rate cut.</p><p>On the economic front overnight, UK July CPI came in hotter than expected, with both headline and core inflation rising +3.8% y/y (vs +3.7% expected, prior +3.6% for headline; vs +3.7% expected, prior +3.7% for core).</p><p>The data underscores lingering inflation pressures, particularly in services inflation (steady at 5.2%) and core services (up to 5.0% from 4.7%), which remain a challenge for the Bank of England as stagflation risks build. The biggest driver was transport costs, especially airfares tied to summer holidays.</p><p>For policy, the outcome reinforces expectations of a BOE pause in September, which markets had already priced at ~94% odds. As such, the inflation surprise is unlikely to materially shift pricing or provide strong upside for sterling. GBPUSD trades flat near 1.3490, with large option expiries at 1.3500 helping cap movement.</p><p>In the US, US MBA mortgage applications fell -1.4% w/w for the week ending August 15, reversing the prior week’s strong +10.9% gain. The market index slipped to 277.1 (from 281.1), with the refinance index down to 926.1 (from 956.2), while the purchase index was little changed at 160.3. The average 30-year mortgage rate edged up to 6.68% from 6.67%. This release is typically not market-moving, with applications remaining inversely correlated to mortgage rates. There are no other economic releases scheduled for the US today.</p><p>However, investors will be awaiting any new policy signals from the Fed as minutes from the last meeting are due today ahead of Chair Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole on Friday. The Fed has kept rates at 4.25%-4.50% all year, but tensions are rising as tariff-driven inflation risks could be just around the corner. On the other hand, there are,political pressure from Trump for cuts. The Fed is divided as we already know that Governors Waller and Bowman dissented, the first double dissent since 1993. Meanwhile, the markets largely expect a 25 bp cut next month, with scope for another later this year, making Powell’s outlook remarks at Jackson Hole highly anticipated. The market currently is pricing and 85% chance for a September cut.</p><p>ECB President Christine Lagarde was speaking today and said that while the euro-area economy showed resilience earlier this year, growth slowed in Q2 and is expected to weaken further in Q3. She noted that recent trade deals, including with the US, have not removed uncertainty, though outcomes are better than worst-case scenarios. The remarks offered no new policy signals, with markets still pricing only about 11 bps of easing by year-end, reflecting less than a 50% probability.</p><p>The NZDUSD moved sharply lower after the RBNZ delivered a dovish message, cutting the OCR by 25 bps to 3% while projecting lower policy rates through 2026. The bank highlighted spare capacity, stalled growth, and cautious household and business behavior as downside risks, with inflation expected to return to target by mid-2026. Updated forecasts show the OCR at 2.71% in Dec 2025 (prev. 2.92%) and 2.59% in Sept 2026 (prev. 2.90%), underscoring scope for further easing if inflation pressures continue to fade. While a 50 bps cut was considered, the committee favored a smaller move to allow gradual adjustment, reinforcing a clear dovish bias toward additional rate cuts.</p><p>Looking at the equity markets in the US, the major indices are trading lower implied by the futures</p><ul><li>Dow industrial average -14.27 points</li><li> NASDAQ index down -47.02 points</li><li>S&P index down -6.37 points.</li></ul><p>In the US debt market, yields are little changed:</p><ul><li>2-year yield 3.752%, -0.2 basis points</li><li>five year yield 3.820%, -0.2 basis points</li><li>10 year yield 4.302%, unchanged</li><li>30 year yield 4.901%, unchanged</li></ul>

USDCHF Technicals The USDCHF runs lower on flight into safety of CHF,"<p>The USDCHF has slid to new lows for both the day and the week, with selling momentum accelerating after the Asian session high at 0.8092 failed to extend beyond last Thursday’s peak. That rejection triggered a downside run through the 200-hour MA (0.80724) and 100-hour MA (0.80678), shifting momentum firmly in favor of sellers.</p><p>In recent hours, the pair has also broken below the five-day floor between 0.80438 and 0.80467, as well as the 50% midpoint of the July 23 decline at 0.80405. The price currently trades at 0.80387, reinforcing a bearish near-term bias.</p><p>For risk management, the immediate pivot is 0.80467 (yesterday’s low). A rebound back above that level would mark a failed breakdown, likely frustrating sellers and prompting a shift toward a more neutral-to-bullish bias in the short term.</p><p>Although the stocks are lower,, they are of their lowest levels. </p><ul><li>The NASDAQ index is back up retesting its 200-hour moving average at 21129.67. The current price is trading at 21092.53 after reaching a high in this hourly bar at 21111.24. The price would need to get back above the 200 hour moving average in order to disappoint the sellers. Alternatively staying below that level could give the sellers more ammunition for another run to the downside. (<a href=""https://investinglive.com/technical-analysis/nasdaq-index-continues-to-take-the-most-heat-to-the-downside-20250820/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">See earlier post</a>)</li><li>The S&P index is also rebounding, and back retesting its 100 hour moving average at 6382.92. The current price is trading at 6381.93. Like the NASDAQ index, the price needs to get and stay above the 100 hour moving average to disappoint the sellers.</li></ul>

If Cook is guilty of mortgage fraud what are the normal penalties?,"<p>The day was started with the accusations that Fed Gov. Lisa Cook was accused of mortgage fraud. More specifically, she was accused of purchasing two properties within a short period of time, and saying that both properties would be her primary residence. If you by a second property, it is largely considered a greater risk and therefore subject to a higher interest rate.</p><p>I don't know the details and according to the letter to Atty. Gen. Bondi, the FHFA Director Pulte accused Cook of the infractions. In other words who knows what actually happened then and subsequently. Did she sell one property a month later? Did she sell one year later?</p><p>More importantly what are the normal penalties for such action.</p><p>If I did it, what would be my penalty? Would I lose my job? Would it prevent me from doing my job?</p><p>I queried ChatGPT and asked what the penalties are for falsely claiming a home as your primary residence. Below are the responses:</p><p>1. Mortgage Fraud (Lenders / Loan Applications)</p><ul><li><p>If you falsely claim a home is your primary residence to get a lower mortgage rate or lower down payment, that is mortgage fraud.</p></li><li><p>Penalties can include:</p><ul><li><p>Loan acceleration (lender demands immediate repayment).</p></li><li><p>Foreclosure if repayment isn’t possible.</p></li><li><p>Fines and restitution.</p></li><li><p>In severe cases, criminal charges — mortgage fraud is a federal offense, punishable by up to 30 years in prison and $1 million fine, though that’s for large-scale or willful fraud. Most cases historically result in financial penalties or loan consequences, not prison.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>2. Tax Treatment of Capital Gains on a Primary Residence</p><ul><li><p>The IRS allows you to exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 married) of capital gains if the home was your primary residence for at least 2 of the past 5 years.</p></li><li><p>If you misrepresent that a property was your primary residence:</p><ul><li><p>The IRS can disallow the exclusion.</p></li><li><p>You’d owe back taxes, interest, and penalties on the capital gains.</p></li><li><p>Civil fraud penalties can be up to 75% of the underpaid tax.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Criminal fraud charges are rarer but possible if misrepresentation was willful.</p></li></ul><p>3. Property Tax / Homestead Exemptions</p><ul><li><p>Some states/counties offer lower property tax rates if the home is a primary residence.</p></li><li><p>If misrepresented:</p><ul><li><p>Back taxes and interest are due.</p></li><li><p>Some jurisdictions add a penalty of 10–50% of the unpaid taxes.</p></li><li><p>Repeat or deliberate fraud can bring criminal charges at the state level.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>✅ Summary:</p><ul><li><p>Lenders → mortgage fraud (serious, possible criminal).</p></li><li><p>IRS → lose capital gains exclusion + taxes/penalties.</p></li><li><p>Local property tax → back taxes + fines.</p></li></ul><p>In most historical cases, the biggest impact is financial (back taxes, penalties, loss of benefits) — jail time is usually reserved for larger, willful fraud schemes.</p><p>What happened? What were the implications? Has she continued to make the payments on both places?</p><p>That is what lawyers are for. One can assume that she will have increased lawyer bills.</p><p>Can Trump fire her?</p><p>Trump wanted to fire Powell one Monday morning after a few extra bogeys on Sunday, but figured out it wasn't possible. Nevertheless, its worth a try.  He did fire the BLS Commissioner, but that was more job-related and who knows, there likely was some payoff that made sense for her to get out of the frying pan. I don't think of BLS Commissioner has the ability of say that the Fed Gov. were Fed chair to earn post position income. </p><p>Chairman Powell seems to be in it for the long haul especially since he's been accused of doing his job, or seeing through a rebuild that was appropriated despite the high costs.</p>

Choppy day with Fed minutes and Fed's Cook drama,"<p>It was a two-way session that ultimately leaned lower for equities, while Treasuries finished near unchanged after giving back early gains. </p><p>The early bid in the front end came as political pressure on Fed Governor Cook intensified, but that faded into the FOMC Minutes, which read on the hawkish side with participants more worried about inflation than the labour market.</p><p>That saw the dollar trim earlier weakness and stocks dip before stabilising a bit into the close. Oil caught a bid on chunky US inventory draws.</p><p>Geopolitics stayed noisy (Russia’s rhetoric around Ukraine talks and Israel calling up 60k reservists), and in FX the kiwi continued to lag after a dovish-tilting RBNZ cut.</p><p>Equities:</p><p>US indices were mixed with a downward bias as the SPX (−0.24%), NDX (−0.58%,) and RUT (−0.32%) all traded in the red. Sector-wise, energy led while big tech softness weighed, with Consumer Discretionary and Technology underperforming. Europe was also mixed, with FTSE 100 firm and DAX softer.</p><p>FX:</p><p>The dollar index eased a touch as recent strength paused, but losses were capped by the FOMC Minutes that was read as a  hawkish tone with most participants still seeing inflation risks. It's very important to keep in mind that the minutes and the FOMC took place before the big NFP revisions, so it doesn't really give us a clean view of the current sentiment among Fed officials.</p><p>Safe-haven CHF and JPY outperformed, while NZD underperformed after the RBNZ cut 25bp to 3.00% with two members favouring 50bp and projections lowered across the curve.</p><p>Commodities:</p><p>Crude moved higher on a EIA’s bigger-than-expected draw with WTI settling at $62.71 (+$0.94). Precious metals also saw strong upside with gold and silver putting in a decent bounce after yesterday's fall (and that despite the USD staying firmer).</p><p>Bonds:</p><p>Treasuries whipsawed and finished little changed overall after an early front-end rally linked to the growing Cook saga with markets pondering implications for Fed independence, and then a fade on the hawkish-tinged Minutes. At the close US10Y settled around 4.297% (−0.5bp) on the session.</p>

On the broader view, gold remains up 32.6% year-over-year and 28% year-to-date, yet is currently cooling, down 2.3% on the week and 3.25% this month.</p><p>For today’s tradeCompass map, the line in the sand is 3388.9. With price already under that threshold, the immediate bias is bearish. A shift to bullish territory requires a break and hold above 3394.5, a zone aligned with yesterday’s value area high and the August 19th point of control.</p><p>Gold Futures Key Levels & Partial-Profit Strategy</p><p>Bearish Path (Active Bias)</p><ul><li><p>3383.1 – Magnet level tied to the August 19th Point of Control.</p></li><li><p>3377.4 – Yesterday’s VWAP, a fair value marker often retested.

The Point of Control (POC) marks the single most traded price, often acting as a price magnet. Watching these zones helps traders anticipate reversals or extensions.</p><p>VWAP</p><p>The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) represents the average traded price adjusted by volume, reflecting “fair value.” Traders use it to gauge whether price is extended (overbought/oversold intraday) or reverting toward balance.</p><p>Liquidity Pools</p><p>Liquidity pools form around clustered orders at round numbers or past highs/lows. Markets often “hunt” these levels to trigger stops or entries, creating short-term volatility and trade opportunities.</p><p>Principles of tradeCompass</p><p>tradeCompass is built for discipline and clarity:</p><ul><li><p>Only one trade per direction per session.</p></li><li><p>Partial profits are taken at logical levels (VWAP, VAL, POC) to reduce risk and lock gains.</p></li><li><p>After the second profit target is hit, stops are moved to entry, protecting capital and shifting into defensive play.</p></li><li><p>No guessing, no chasing – just a clean directional map.</p></li></ul><p>tradeCompass Trade Management Reminders</p><ul><li><p>Respect the thresholds – bearish remains valid until bulls reclaim 3394.5.</p></li><li><p>Stops should never exceed the opposite threshold, as this invalidates the compass signal.</p></li><li><p>Focus on defense first – protecting profits and limiting risk is key.</p></li><li><p>Remember, the first targets may be tight; they’re designed to test conviction and secure flexibility for the trade.</p></li></ul><p>Utilize tradeCompass by investingLive.com (formerly ForexLive)</p><p>This analysis is produced with the tradeCompass methodology and serves as decision-support, not financial advice.

The data is likely to be important ahead of Powell's speech and given the Fed's focus on the labour market conditions. </p><p>The US PMIs are expected to ease slightly with the Manufacturing PMI expected at 49.5 vs 49.8 prior and Services PMI seen at 54.2 vs 55.7 prior.

</li><li>Prior 50.6</li><li>Composite PMI 50.9 vs 50.2 expected
</li><li>Prior 50.6</li></ul><p>Comment:</p><p>Commenting on the flash PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:</p><p>“Germany’s economy has been growing throughout the summer so far, and the pace of expansion has even picked up
slightly. While we’re talking about modest gains here, this trend signals resilience – considering the headwinds like U.S.
tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, and relatively high long-term interest rates.
</p><p>“The recovery is being driven primarily by the manufacturing sector, where output has now increased for six consecutive
months, with the latest data showing a noticeable uptick. Particularly encouraging is the surge in new orders, which saw their
strongest growth since March 2022. That said, a certain degree of caution remains among businesses. Stocks of inputs
continue to decline sharply, which aligns with reduced purchasing activity. This suggests companies are still playing it safe.
</p><p>“In manufacturing, firms have been cutting jobs at a faster pace. That’s clearly bad news for those affected, and it could be
seen as a negative economic signal. But it’s likely part of a broader effort to boost productivity and sharpen competitiveness.
At least in the short term, this seems to be working – output has risen significantly.
</p><p>“Input prices in manufacturing have fallen, helped by lower oil prices and a relatively strong euro. On the sales side,
manufacturers have passed on some of these cost savings to their customers. In contrast, the services sector saw the
opposite trend in August: costs rose more sharply – likely due to rising wages – and companies had enough pricing power to
pass parts of those increases on to their clients.”</p>

UK August flash services PMI 53.6 vs 51.8 expected,"<ul><li>Prior 51.8</li><li>Manufacturing PMI 47.3 vs 48.3 expected</li><li>Prior 48.0</li><li>Composite PMI 53.0 vs 51.6 expected</li><li>Prior 51.5</li></ul><p>Key Findings:</p><ul><li>Strongest rise in UK private sector business activity since August 2024</li></ul><p>Comment:</p><p>Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P
Global Market Intelligence:
</p><p>“The flash UK PMI survey for August indicated that the
pace of economic growth has continued to accelerate
over the summer after a sluggish spring, the rate of
expansion now at a one-year high. The services sector
has led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed
further signs of stabilising.
</p><p>""It’s evident from survey measures of order books,
however, that the demand environment remains both
uneven and fragile. Companies report concerns over
the impact of recent government policy changes, as
well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical
uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially
sharply.
</p><p>""Payroll numbers also continue to be cut at an
aggressive rate by historical standards as firms cite
weak order books and concerns over rising staff costs
due to the policies announced in the autumn Budget,
which also contributed to persistent inflation pressures.
</p><p>""While the rise in business activity signalled by the PMI
alongside the uplift in inflation to 3.8% in July lower
the chances of further rate cuts this year, more data
are required to assess both the sustainability of robust
economic growth as well as the stickiness of the upturn
in price pressures. Among a divided Bank of England rate

The ups and downs continue in currency markets as all eyes are on the Fed chair tomorrow,"<p>The USD is little changed vs the EUR and the GBP to kickstart the US day in what is becoming a pattern of up and down trading. The USDJPY is retracing the losses from yeaterday (and more). in the video above, I take a technical view of each of the pairs and try to make technical sense of the price action BTW.  All eyes are on the Fed Chair Powell's speech tomorrow, but today the initial jobless claims and continuing claims (estimate 225K versus 224K and 1.960 million versus 1.953 million respectively) will be the focus. There is also the Philadelphia Fed business index (7.0 versus 15.9 last month), Canadian producer prices (0.3% versus 0.4% last month), the S&P Manufacturing PMI flash (estimate 49.5 versus 49.8), and existing home sales (3.92M versus 3.93M last month) to ponder.</p><p>Overnight The PMI flash estimates for the EU and UK were mixed. Below is a summary of the beats and misses:</p><p>BEAT:</p><ul><li><p>French Flash Manufacturing PMI: 49.9 vs 48.2 expectation (Previous 48.2)</p></li><li><p>French Flash Services PMI: 49.7 vs 48.5 expectation (Previous 48.5)</p></li><li><p>German Flash Manufacturing PMI: 49.9 vs 48.8 expectation (Previous 49.1)</p></li><li><p>Eurozone Flash Manufacturing PMI: 50.5 vs 49.5 expectation (Previous 49.8)</p></li><li><p>UK Flash Services PMI: 53.6 vs 51.8 expectation (Previous 51.8)</p></li></ul><p>MISSED:</p><ul><li><p>German Flash Services PMI: 50.1 vs 50.4 expectation (Previous 50.6)</p></li><li><p>Eurozone Flash Services PMI: 50.7 vs 50.8 expectation (Previous 51.0)</p></li><li><p>UK Flash Manufacturing PMI: 47.3 vs 48.2 expectation (Previous 48.0)</p></li></ul><p>The US and EU issued a joint statement outlining the framework of their recent trade agreement, highlighting tariff relief on autos that could come in “hopefully weeks” once the EU introduces legislation to lower tariffs. The EU committed to eliminating tariffs on all US industrial goods, granting preferential access for US seafood and agriculture, and procuring $750 billion in US energy products, while also planning $600 billion in strategic US investments through 2028. In return, the US will maintain 15% tariffs on most EU imports, including autos, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, but pledged to reduce auto tariffs once the EU’s legislation is introduced. For now, the statement remains a framework rather than a finalized trade deal.</p><p>Ukrainian President Zelensky said Kyiv wants clarity on security guarantees within 7–10 days, stressing the need for a strong U.S. reaction if Russia resists bilateral talks. He outlined plans for a $50 billion U.S. drone deal over five years, including mass production of 10 million drones and Ukraine’s new “Flamingo” missile. Zelensky rejected Budapest as a peace venue, reaffirmed that Ukraine will not recognize Russian-occupied territories, and excluded China from guarantees due to its stance after the invasion. He added that Moscow shows no willingness to end the war, while Ukraine has tested a new long-range missile. War is bad.  </p><p>Looking at the premarket for US stocks, the major indices are lower. A snapshot shows:</p><ul><li>Dow industrial average -179 points</li><li>S&P index -19.28 points</li><li>NASDAQ index -55 points</li></ul><p>Walmart announced its earnings this morning, and EPS came in weaker than expected at $0.68 versus $0.73 expected. Revenues were higher however, at $177.4 billion versus $176.09 billion. They did raise the net sales and EPS outlook for fiscal year 2026. Walmart shares are down 3.4% in premarket trading.</p><p>US yields are up about to basis points across curve:</p><ul><li>2-year yield 3.764%, +2.0 basis points</li><li>5 year yield 3.830%, +2.1 basis points</li><li>10 year yield 4.316%, +2.0 basis points</li><li>30 year yield 4.924%, +2.0 basis points</li></ul>

This supports wage and inflation pressures.</p></li><li><p>Yields and dollar: Rising inflationary signals and stronger growth bias toward higher yields and a firmer USD.</p></li></ul><p>Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence:</p><blockquote>A strong flash PMI reading for August adds to signs that US businesses have enjoyed a strong third quarter so far. The data are consistent with the economy expanding at a 2.5% annualized rate, up from the average 1.3% expansion seen over the first two quarters of the year.</blockquote><blockquote>Companies across both manufacturing and services are reporting stronger demand conditions, but are struggling to meet sales growth, causing backlogs of work to rise at a pace not seen since the pandemic-related capacity constraints recorded in early 2022. Stock building of finished goods has also risen at a survey record pace, linked in part to worries over future supply conditions. While this upturn in demand has fueled a surge in hiring, it has also bolstered firms’ pricing power. Companies have consequently passed tariff-related cost increases through to customers in increasing numbers, indicating that inflation pressures are now at their highest for three years.         </blockquote><blockquote>The resulting rise in selling prices for goods and services suggests that consumer price inflation will rise further above the Fed’s 2% target in the coming months. Indeed, combined with the upturn in business activity and hiring, the rise in prices signaled by the survey puts the PMI data more into rate hiking, rather than cutting, territory according to the historical relationship between these economic indicators and FOMC policy changes.</blockquote>

The USD is moving higher after flash PMI and home sales beat expectations,"<p>The USD is stretching higher as the S&P global and the existing home sales beat expectations. That has lessened the chance of a September rate cut to 75%. Recall last week it was as high as 100%. Fed Chair Powell will speak tomorrow at 10 AM. Although September data is going to be key ahead of the rate decision mid-month, at this moment, it is hard to justify Powell being anything other than data -dependent despite the pressure to cut rates and the weaker jobs report. He may tilt because of a more dual focus, but to go all-in for a cut is not likely.</p><p>EURUSD Technical Update: The 50% retracement is the downside target at 1.16098.</p><p>
The EURUSD has pushed to a fresh low, moving into the swing area between 1.16098 and 1.16309. Yesterday’s low traded within this zone, while last Thursday’s decline stalled right at its upper boundary. Importantly, the 50% midpoint of the broader move down from the July 1 high to the August 1 low comes in at 1.16098—a critical level at the base of this swing area.</p><p>On the topside, today’s European session high stalled just below a confluence of resistance: the 61.8% retracement at 1.1661 and the 100- and 200-hour moving averages clustered just above at 1.1664. The failure to break above this zone handed the technical edge back to sellers.</p><p>The question now is whether sellers can press momentum further with a decisive move below the 50% midpoint at 1.16098. A break would signal growing downside control and open the door for deeper retracement targets.</p><p>GBPUSD Technical Update: Focus turns to the 100 day MA</p><p>The GBPUSD extended to a swing area near 1.3436 earlier in the day, and then bounced higher taken the price back above the 50% midpoint of the move down from the July 1 high at 1.3463. The high price reached 1.3481 Before rotating back down with more momentum in the early US session off of the better data. The low price of just reached 1.3423</p><p>The next key targeted is fast approaching at the rising 100 day moving average at 1.34078 (see overlay blue line on the chart above).</p><p>USDJPY Technical: Extends into swing area resistance </p><p>The USDJPY fell yesterday but has rebounded firmly today, reclaiming key technical levels. The recovery took the pair back above the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, which currently straddle the 147.50 area.</p><p>The initial upside extension reached into the lower boundary of a swing area between 147.95 and 148.166 before sellers stepped in. That pullback saw the pair retest the 100- and 200-hour moving averages, but buyers defended the zone and reestablished control.</p><p>Stronger-than-expected data has since fueled a fresh push higher, with price action extending deeper into the swing area. Notably, over the last seven trading sessions, the USDJPY has tested this area on four separate occasions, underscoring its importance as a technical pivot.</p><p>A decisive break above 148.166 would be a key bullish development, opening the door for further upside momentum in the days ahead.</p>

NASDAQ index traded above and below its 200 hour moving average,"<p>The NASDAQ and the S&P index are both down around -0.45% on the day and trading closer to their lows. The S&P index is down -20.2 point or -0.45% at 6367.48. The NASDAQ index is down -102 points or -0.48% at 21071.50.</p><p>Looking at the hourly chart of the S&P index, it trades between its 100 and 200-hour  moving averages. At the session low today, the price did bounce off of the 200-hour moving average (green line on the chart above), keeping the technical bias more neutral. Having said that, the high for the day did extend above its higher 100-hour moving average at 6385.78, but failed to gather additional upside momentum. A move below the 200 hour MA with more momentum, will open the downside for more probing. The 38.2% at 6275.14 of the move up from the June 23 low would be a target on more selling. </p><p>Looking at the hourly chart of the NASDAQ index, the price action has  been above and below its 200 hour moving average (Green line at 21150.40), but remains well below the 100 hour moving average at 21332.46. Staying below those moving averages is a bearish tilt with the 38.2% at 20864.09 and the 50% at 20571.83 targets on more selling momentum . </p><p>With Fed Chair Powell scheduled to speak tomorrow at 10 AM, I am not surprised that the market is taking a more cautious approach with the increased risk.  Price action tomorrow will be more volatile.  </p>

Markets have been eagerly waiting for Powell's speech to see whether the recent downward revisions to NFP has opened up the door for more or faster rate cuts.</p><p>Depending on the tone of the speech, it could set the mood for broader markets until we get the next NFP report, so will be an important one to keep on the radar.</p>

PBOC is expected to set the USD/CNY reference rate at 7.1871 – Reuters estimate,"<p>People's Bank of China USD/CNY reference rate is due around 0115 GMT.</p><p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, is responsible for setting the daily midpoint of the yuan (also known as renminbi or RMB). The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a ""band,"" around a central reference rate, or ""midpoint."" It's currently at +/- 2%.</p><p>How the process works:</p><ul type=""disc""><li>Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day's trading.</li><li>The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.</li><li>Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency's value</li></ul>

All eyes on Jackson Hole as markets look to wrap up the week,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">It's going to be all about the anticipation ahead of the main event later in European trading today. All eyes are on Fed chair Powell's speech with the Jackson Hole Symposium set to kick off later today.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Given the market positioning, one can argue that traders and investors have pulled back on the more dovish Fed sentiment from last week. That as the expectation is for Powell to not pre-commit or be explicit about cutting rates next month. If anything, Powell is expected to reaffirm a more data dependent approach and leaving it to the upcoming US jobs data in two weeks' time.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The anticipation that Powell might lean more hawkishly has seen stocks pull back from the highs this week and the dollar firming in the past few sessions. That as we also see Fed policymakers give a little bit of a nudge in not suggesting that September is a given. As things stand, traders are pricing in ~74% odds of a 25 bps rate cut now. That is a modest retreat from having fully priced in such a rate cut after the US CPI report last week.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">Here are some notes to wrap your head around before we get to big stage later in the day:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/jackson-hole-on-the-horizon-for-markets-this-week-20250818/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Jackson Hole on the horizon for markets this week</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/where-is-nowcasts-for-growth-and-inflation-ahead-of-powells-speech-20250822/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Where is nowcasts for growth and inflation ahead of Powell's speech</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/what-is-rate-expectations-for-the-fed-ahead-of-powells-speech-20250822/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">What is rate expectations for the Fed ahead of Powell's speech</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/implied-volatility-levels-for-major-assets-ahead-of-jackson-hole-20250822/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Implied volatility levels for major assets ahead of Jackson Hole</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/fed-chair-powell-to-adopt-a-more-cautious-approach-at-jackson-hole-mufg-20250819/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Fed chair Powell to adopt a more cautious approach at Jackson Hole - MUFG</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/fed-focus-now-turns-to-labour-market-with-jackson-hole-up-next-socgen-20250821/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Fed focus now turns to labour market with Jackson Hole up next - SocGen</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/centralbank/jackson-hole-symposium-agenda-20250822/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">Jackson Hole Symposium Agenda</a></li><li><a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/what-else-to-expect-from-the-jackson-hole-symposium-later-this-week-20250820/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">What else to expect from the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week?</a></li></ul>

China president Xi Jinping likely to skip ASEAN Summit in October - report,"<p class=""text-align-justify"">That's a bit of a blow for those expecting a potential Trump-Xi meeting in Malaysia on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit. That especially after Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, confirmed US president Trump's attendance <a href=""https://investinglive.com/news/us-president-trump-said-to-confirm-attendance-for-asean-summit-in-october-20250731/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Given the circumstances if Xi does not attend, it would be reasonable to expect Trump to pull out from the event as well.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">The sources for the report here are saying that Chinese premier Li Qiang is set to represent China at the summit instead.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">If anything, that speaks to the status of the current ""deal"" between the two countries. As things stand, they're both just playing nice and putting on a show while avoiding any further escalation in trade conflict. But rest assured, the animosity and acrimony is still very much felt.</p><p class=""text-align-justify"">And China is certainly making that clear by not giving face to the US with this move here. So, now expect Trump to also deny that he ever confirmed his attendance to Malaysia this coming October.</p>

That said, business sentiment for retail trade fell on the month but was offset by brighter prospects in building construction. However, employment conditions continue to fall off after a bounce in June earlier, with the indicator there falling back to 95 (down from 96 in July). That's the lowest reading since May.</p>

GBPUSD tilts the bias back to the upside,"<p>The GBPUSD surged higher, breaking through a series of key resistance levels. The rally cleared the 50% midpoint of the decline from the July 1 high at 1.3463, followed by the 100-hour moving average at 1.3468, and extended to test the 200-hour moving average at 1.3505. The 200-hour moving average now serves as a key risk level for buyers—a move back below it would undermine today’s bullish breakout.</p><p>The pair is currently hovering around the 61.8% retracement of the July 1 move lower at 1.3539, with traders testing both sides of the level. Further resistance lies ahead at a well-defined ceiling between 1.3576 and 1.3592, an area reinforced by swing highs from July 23–24 and August 13–15, where sellers consistently capped upside attempts.</p><p>A sustained push above this ceiling would mark an important technical shift, reinforcing the bullish bias and opening the door for additional upside momentum. Conversely, failure to hold above the 200-hour moving average would be seen as a setback for the breakout.</p><p>Taking a longer-term view, this week’s corrective move to the downside briefly pushed the price below its 100-day moving average, a development that tilted the outlook more bearish from a broader perspective. Heading into the Chair’s speech, the pair was hovering right around that key average, leaving the market at a crossroads. However, the sharp rebound higher effectively cast the vote for a weaker dollar. Looking ahead, the ability to hold above those recent lows near the 100-day moving average strengthens the bullish backdrop, with that zone now serving as an important technical floor.</p>

His remarks acknowledged a “curious balance” in the labor market, persistent though tariff-driven inflation pressures, and the Fed’s ongoing challenge of balancing its dual mandate. Powell struck a tone that leaned cautiously dovish, leaving the door open to rate cuts while stressing that decisions remain firmly anchored to incoming data and the evolving economic outlook</p><p>Key Highlights</p><ul><li><p>Door to September rate cut opened
Powell suggested the Fed may consider cutting rates next month, noting both labor demand and supply are slowing. While he stopped short of committing to a move, his tone leaned more dovish.</p></li><li><p>Labor market risks rising
Job growth has weakened, with risks of a faster rise in unemployment. Powell stressed the balance of risks has shifted, putting employment on more fragile footing.</p></li><li><p>Tariff-driven inflation likely temporary
Tariffs are pushing up prices, but Powell emphasized that these effects are likely short-lived one-time shifts, not a lasting inflation dynamic. Still, he flagged risks from potential wage–price spirals or rising expectations.</p></li><li><p>Fed remains data-driven and independent
Powell reaffirmed that the Fed’s path is not preset, with all decisions based on incoming data. He also underscored the Fed’s independence amid external political pressures.</p></li></ul><p>Later, Fed’s Hammack (2026 voter) struck a more hawkish/less dovish tone than markets took from Powell. She emphasized that inflation remains too high and continues to pressure households, requiring the Fed to keep policy mostly restrictive. While she noted the Fed is only modestly restrictive and close to neutral, she stressed that the focus must remain squarely on bringing inflation back toward target. Hammack said she is open-minded going into September, with more data to assess, but underscored that a significant weakening in unemployment would be needed to justify easier policy. For now, she views risks as tilted toward persistence in inflation and signaled caution against easing too quickly.</p><p>Although the Fed chair laid the pipe for a cut,  US jobs data and US inflation data are to come. The market did start to price in more of a cut. With the futures now pricing in a 90% chance of a cut in September.</p><p>US stocks moved sharply higher. Prior to the jump, the NASDAQ index was threatening to make a break below and away from its 200-hour moving average earlier this week (at 21169) and indeed did trade below that moving average level this week. However, with today's gains the price surged back above that key moving average level and also back above its 100-hour moving average at 21368. The buyers are back in job control.</p><p>Despite the gains today, the NASDAQ index still closed the lower for the week (-0.58%). The S&P and Dow industrial average did close higher with the Dow industrial average rising by 1.53%. The S&P had a modest gain of 0.27%. The small-cap Russell 2000 of the back of a 3.86% rise today close the week up 3.298%.</p><p>European equities closed the session higher across the board, extending gains into the week. The German DAX rose 0.29%, the French CAC gained 0.40%, and the UK FTSE 100 advanced 0.13%, finishing at a new record high. Southern Europe led the day, with Spain’s Ibex up 0.61% and Italy’s FTSE MIB climbing 0.69%, both settling at 17–18 year highs. For the week, momentum was also positive: the DAX added 0.02%, the CAC 0.58%, the FTSE 100 2.0%, the Ibex 0.78%, and the FTSE MIB 1.54%, underscoring broad strength in European markets</p><p>US yields move lower with the shorter end influence the most.</p><ul><li>2 year yield 3.694%, -9.8 basis points</li><li> 5 year yield 3.757%, -10.2 basis points</li><li>10 year yield 4.253%, -7.8 basis points</li><li>30 year yield 4.876% -4.7 basis points</li></ul><p>The US dollar moved sharply to the downside along with the lower yields in the expectations of Fed cuts.</p><ul><li>EUR -1.0%</li><li>GBP -0.98%</li><li>JPY -0.83%</li><li>CHF -0.92%</li><li>CAD -0.60%</li><li>AUD -1.07%</li><li>NZD -0.86%</li></ul>

On the data front, New Zealand retail sales surprised to the upside in Q2, a sign that lower RBNZ rates are boosting household consumption and supporting recovery.</p><p>Across equities, Asia-Pac markets traded mostly higher, buoyed by expectations that Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks have left the door open to a September Fed rate cut.</p><p class=""western"">

3422.9 – another key level just under Friday’s POC</p><p>(Swing trader extensions)
3435.9 – extended VWAP deviation from Friday
3456.1 – broader standard deviation zone</p><p>Analysis of Gold Futures Today: Market Context & Directional Bias</p><p>At the time of this gold futures analysis today, price sits at 3408.5, slightly under the bearish threshold of 3409.7. That places the market in bearish mode according to the tradeCompass methodology.</p><p>If bearish momentum holds, gold futures traders can expect intraday targets near 3406.7 and 3405.7. For bullish traders, price must reclaim 3414.1 to flip sentiment and aim for higher resistance levels.</p><p>This close clustering of thresholds and targets suggests a condensed gold trading range today, where sharp moves may occur once either side gains control.</p><p>Educational Segment: Why Value Area, VWAP, and Deviations Matter in Gold Trading</p><ul><li><p>Value Area: The zone where 70% of trading volume occurs. The Value Area High (VAH) and Value Area Low (VAL) help define likely support and resistance.</p></li><li><p>VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): Viewed as “fair value,” it reflects the true balance of price and traded volume. Gold futures above VWAP indicate buyer dominance, below it seller control.</p></li><li><p>Standard Deviations of VWAP: These act like volatility bands. They expand in trending gold markets and contract in consolidations, often marking turning points intraday.</p></li></ul><p>By focusing on these levels, tradeCompass creates an objective trading map for gold futures rather than relying on guesswork.</p><p>tradeCompass Methodology & Key Principles for Gold Traders</p><ul><li><p>One trade per direction per session.</p></li><li><p>Stops always placed logically, never beyond the opposite threshold.</p></li><li><p>Move stops to entry once the second profit target is reached.</p></li><li><p>Confirmation style is flexible: some traders wait for two candle closes above/below thresholds, others prefer momentum triggers.</p></li></ul><p>This disciplined approach helps gold traders protect capital and stay aligned with market structure.</p><p>Conclusion: Gold Price Prediction Today</p><p>The gold technical analysis today shows a bearish bias below 3409.7, with first targets at 3406.7 and 3405.7. Bulls must reclaim 3414.1 to shift the market higher. Swing traders may watch for extensions toward 3377.5 on the downside or 3456.1 on the upside.</p><p>Despite the intraday bearish lean, gold remains one of the best-performing assets in 2025 — up 29.1% year-to-date and 35.2% over one year — keeping it firmly on the radar for both traders and long-term investors.</p><p>For more gold trading ideas, commodity forecasts, and stock/crypto setups, visit <a class=""decorated-link"" href=""https://investinglive.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"">investingLive.com</a> and join our Telegram group:

What are the interest rates expectations after Powell's dovish tilt?,"<p>Rate cuts by year-end</p><ul><li>Fed: 54 bps (85% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)  </li><li>ECB: 9 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    </li><li>BoE: 12 bps (97% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    </li><li>BoC: 23 bps (67% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
    </li><li>RBA: 37 bps (63% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)</li><li>RBNZ: 35 bps (64% probability of rate cut at the upcoming meeting)
    </li><li>SNB: 7 bps (91% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)
</li></ul><p>Rate hikes by year-end</p><ul><li>BoJ: 18 bps (88% probability of no change at the upcoming meeting)</li></ul><p>Traders reacted strongly to Fed Chair Powell's speech text once they saw the line “nonetheless, with
policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance
of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” That was interpreted as a dovish tilt and the pricing at some point showed more than 60 bps of easing by year-end and more than 90% of probability of a September cut.</p><p>Eventually, things eased up and we got back to the levels seen just before Powell's speech text release. The focus now turns to the NFP report due next week as that's going to be key for interest rates expectations. Strong data might take the probability for a
September cut towards a 50/50 chance but will certainly see a more hawkish
repricing further down the curve. Soft data, on the other hand, will likely see
traders increasing the dovish bets with a third cut by year-end being priced
in.</p>

The recovery continues to stall beneath the 0.8040–0.8047 resistance zone, which also lines up with prior swing levels and the 50% midpoint of the July rally. Staying below keeps the bias tilted to the downside.</p><p>On the downside, the 0.8017 low of the red box is the first support to watch. A break below the 61.8% retracement of the July rally at 0.8010 would re-open the door for sellers, with the next targets seen near 0.7986–0.7994.</p><p>Bottom line: As long as price holds inside the ""red box"" there is a battle with the buyers and sellers.

However, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on broader financial markets. The purchase demonstrates the high value attached to rare sports memorabilia and the willingness of wealthy individuals to invest in these items. This could potentially influence the prices of similar items in the future. Nevertheless, this is a niche market and its influence over larger sectors such as stocks, bonds, or commodities is minimal. This event could, however, be indicative of the overall health of the luxury goods and collectibles market, which can sometimes be a reflection of broader economic trends. But, given its specificity, the confidence level that this event would influence broader financial markets is high.",

To fend off competition, PDD is spending more to boost its revenue. This move is causing a rise in its stock as investors seem to be satisfied with the trade-off. While this strategy might help PDD in the short term, it could potentially lead to financial instability in the long term due to increased expenditure. The competition with Alibaba, a well-established and financially robust company, could further strain PDD's resources. However, if PDD's strategy pays off, it could secure a larger market share, which would be beneficial for its long-term growth. Investors seem to be optimistic about this strategy, as evidenced by the rise in PDD's stock. But the high cost and the strong competition from Alibaba make this a risky move, hence the negative impact score.",

The increased spending could potentially impact the company's profitability if it fails to significantly increase its market share or if the competition intensifies further. This could lead to a drop in the company's stock price. However, the current investor satisfaction and rising stock prices indicate a positive short-term outlook.

While the increased spending might lead to short-term gains, it could also lead to financial instability if the company fails to maintain its growth or if the competition intensifies. Therefore, the impact on the market is slightly bearish.

This is likely to have a significant negative impact on sectors that heavily rely on lumber, such as housing, construction, and furniture. As the cost of raw material increases, the cost of production for these industries will also rise, which could lead to increased prices for consumers. This could potentially slow down the housing market, as the cost to build houses may become prohibitively high. Furthermore, it could also lead to a decrease in demand for furniture and other goods made from lumber, as prices rise. The high confidence level is due to the direct correlation between tariffs and increased costs, which has been observed in similar situations in the past.",

This could indicate a potential overvaluation of the stock, which is often followed by a market correction. The current hype around AI technology may be inflating Figma's stock price beyond its actual value, creating an unstable situation. When the excitement around a new technology or market sector wanes, it's common to see a correction in stock prices. This has been seen in the past with the dot-com bubble and more recently with certain cryptocurrency stocks. Therefore, while Figma has shown strong performance, the inflated stock price and potential overvaluation could lead to a negative impact on its stock in the near future.",

If this is the case, there could be a correction in the future, which would result in a drop in the stock's price. This is similar to what happened during the tech bubble in the late 1990s. Therefore, while the AI industry is indeed promising, it's crucial to ensure that the stock prices of companies in this sector reflect their true value and not just the hype surrounding the technology.",

This has happened before in the tech sector, most notably during the Dotcom Bubble in the late 90s and early 2000s, when many internet-based companies were highly overvalued due to hype. When these companies failed to deliver on their promises, their stocks crashed, leading to a market correction. Therefore, while the AI hype may currently be benefiting Figma, it also poses a risk if the company fails to meet the high expectations set by its stock price.",

This could negatively impact the EU market and tech sector. Furthermore, the potential 200% tariff on China if they don't supply magnets to the US could escalate trade tensions, affecting the metals market. On the other hand, Trump's willingness to allow Chinese students to study in the US and his potential visit to China could be seen as positive signs for easing tensions. However, the overall impact of these policies is still uncertain, hence the medium confidence level. The potential for increased geopolitical tensions could lead to market volatility, negatively impacting investor sentiment.",
What's likely behind the 2% drop in Starbucks stock during Monday's session,"Every weekday, the Investing Club releases the Homestretch; an actionable afternoon update just in time for the last hour of trading.",2025-08-25T18:58:34+00:00,Finance,"S&P 500, Consumer Discretionary, Restaurant",medium,-2,medium,Similar to the historical pattern when Starbucks shares fell due to unexpected negative earnings reports.,"The 2% drop in Starbucks stock during Monday's trading session is likely due to a combination of factors. One possible cause could be a negative reaction to recent news or events related to the company. For instance, if Starbucks announced lower than expected earnings, or if there were negative reports about the company's operations, this could lead to a sell-off of the stock. Another possible reason could be broader market trends. If the overall market is down, many stocks, including Starbucks, could be affected. Additionally, investor sentiment towards the consumer discretionary sector, which Starbucks is a part of, could also play a role. If investors are turning away from this sector in favor of more defensive sectors, Starbucks' stock price could be negatively impacted. Finally, it's also possible that the drop is simply due to normal fluctuations in the stock market. Stocks often rise and fall in the short term due to a variety of factors, including changes in investor sentiment, market trends, and company-specific news. Without more specific information, it's impossible to say for sure why Starbucks' stock price fell on this particular day.",

As many of Starbucks' stores are located in urban areas and rely on foot traffic, social distancing measures and work-from-home arrangements could potentially be impacting the company's revenue. Additionally, the overall market sentiment could also be playing a role. If the broader market is bearish, this could be dragging down Starbucks' stock. Finally, any recent company-specific news or events could also be contributing to the stock's decline.

For instance, if Starbucks recently announced a change in strategy or leadership, or released a weaker-than-expected earnings report, this could cause a drop in the stock price. Another potential reason could be investor sentiment. If investors are becoming more bearish on the food and beverage sector, or on Starbucks specifically, this could lead to selling pressure and a decrease in the stock price. It's also possible that the drop is simply due to normal market fluctuations and doesn't indicate a larger trend. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the drop.",

However, the contrarian view mentioned in the article suggests that an increase in predictions of a bubble actually makes it less likely to occur. This is because these predictions can cause investors to act more cautiously, potentially preventing the market from overheating and forming a bubble. It should be noted that predicting market bubbles is notoriously difficult and not all bubbles lead to crashes. While the perception of a bubble could have a negative impact on market sentiment in the short term, the contrarian view suggests it could actually stabilize the market in the long term.",

The idea that a large number of investors predicting a bubble actually makes it less likely to occur is a contrarian view, suggesting that the market may behave in the opposite way to the majority opinion. This is because if a significant number of investors believe the market is overvalued and start selling their stocks, it could lead to a decrease in stock prices. However, it's also possible that this contrarian view could lead to complacency, as investors may believe the market is 'safe' from a bubble due to the high number of predictions. This could potentially lead to an actual bubble forming if investors continue to overvalue stocks. It's a complex situation with many variables, hence the medium confidence level.",

Still, the mere perception of a bubble can create a sense of uncertainty and risk aversion, which might lead to a slowdown in market activity and a moderate negative impact on market performance.

Could your financial adviser’s politics hurt your investments?,What to keep in mind when mixing politics and portfolios.,2025-08-25T19:55:00+00:00,Finance,All,medium,-3,medium,"Historically, political bias in financial advice has led to skewed investment decisions, most notably during the 2016 US Presidential Election","The political affiliations of a financial adviser can potentially influence their investment advice and consequently, the performance of your portfolio. This is because an adviser's political bias can lead to subjective assessments of market trends, economic policies, and fiscal risks. For instance, an adviser with conservative political views might overemphasize the risks of progressive economic policies, thus skewing their investment advice towards more conservative assets. Conversely, an adviser with progressive political views might downplay the risks of progressive economic policies, thus skewing their investment advice towards more aggressive assets. This could lead to sub-optimal investment decisions that do not align with the actual market trends and risks. Therefore, it is important for investors to be aware of their adviser's political affiliations and to ensure that their investment advice is based on objective market analyses rather than political biases.",

The news of crude oil futures settling at $64.80 could also have a significant impact on the energy sector. The new home sales for July 2025 coming in better than expected is a positive sign for the housing market, but the year-over-year sales fell by -8.2%, indicating a possible slowdown.

While the video has gone viral and initiated discussions about consumer behavior, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the financial markets. The video may highlight a trend of bulk buying or hoarding, which could potentially impact retailers and consumer goods companies in the short term. However, these trends are typically short-lived and do not have a lasting impact on the stock performance of companies in these sectors. Furthermore, viral content can be unpredictable and does not always translate into substantial shifts in consumer behavior. Therefore, while this news is interesting from a sociological perspective, its financial impact is expected to be negligible, hence the low confidence rating.",

Powell just gambled big in Jackson Hole.

This move suggests that the Fed is concerned about the state of the economy and is willing to take measures to stimulate growth. While this could lead to a short-term increase in stock market performance, as investors often react positively to lower interest rates, it could also raise concerns about the health of the economy. Lower interest rates can stimulate borrowing and investing, but they also suggest that the economy might not be strong enough to withstand higher rates. Additionally, this move could weaken the dollar in the forex market, as lower interest rates often lead to a less attractive currency for foreign investors. Therefore, while this move could have positive short-term effects, it could also signal potential long-term economic instability.",

Interest rate cuts are typically used as a tool to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, thereby encouraging spending and investment. However, they can also signal that the economy is in a weaker state, which could lead to a negative market reaction. In this case, the surprise move has the potential to unsettle investors who were not expecting such a decision. On the other hand, if the cut leads to the desired economic stimulation, it could boost the markets in the long-term. The impact on sectors such as banking and finance could be mixed. While lower interest rates can squeeze banks' net interest margins, they can also lead to increased loan volumes. The overall impact is therefore slightly bearish in the short-term, but could potentially be positive in the long-term if the rate cut successfully stimulates the economy.",

However, it could also lower borrowing costs, which would be beneficial for companies and could potentially boost the stock market in the long run. The bond market is likely to be directly affected, with bond prices generally rising as interest rates fall. The banking sector could also be affected, as lower interest rates can squeeze banks' profit margins. However, the impact of this decision will depend on a variety of factors, including the size and timing of the rate cut, the state of the economy, and the market's expectations. It's also worth noting that Powell's decision was unexpected, which could add to market volatility in the short term.",

His attempt to oust Cook undercut the USD on two fronts: by signalling his desire to stack the Fed with loyalists to force rate cuts, and by undermining confidence in the Bank’s independence.</p><p>The dollar weakened broadly, with gold the standout gainer and safe-haven flows into JPY and CHF driving USD/JPY down to 147.00 and USD/CHF to 0.8030. EUR, GBP, AUD, and NZD also advanced. The dollar later clawed back some ground, though mainly as modest retracement.</p><p>Legal questions quickly followed Trump’s post, with debate over whether he has the authority to dismiss a Fed governor at all. Powell could set a precedent by insisting Cook remain during the challenge, while some suggested a middle ground of her staying on but not voting until the courts decide. More cynical takes held that Trump’s social media theatrics were designed to stir dollar and gold moves for the benefit/profit of his circle.</p><p>Other developments were overshadowed by the firing saga. New York Fed President John Williams spoke but offered no policy outlook, while RBA minutes read as less hawkish than expected. Trump threatened countries that have digital taxes with ‘subsequent additional tariffs’ on their goods if those nations do not remove such legislation.</p>

The US Dollar has tumbled, while safe-haven assets like gold, JPY, and CHF have seen a surge. This is due to the perceived undermining of the Federal Reserve's independence, a crucial pillar for market stability. Moreover, the legality of the firing has been questioned, adding to market uncertainty and further pressuring the dollar. The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to stack the Fed with loyalists to force rate cuts, potentially leading to an overheated economy. Additionally, this could be seen as a strategic move to manipulate dollar and gold prices for the benefit of his circle, further eroding market confidence. Other market developments were overshadowed by this event, highlighting its significance. Therefore, the overall impact of this news is highly bearish for the dollar and bullish for safe-haven assets.",

If confirmed, this could have a substantial impact on both economies, potentially leading to increased investment and economic growth. The Japanese negotiator's demand for a presidential order to cut US tariffs on Japanese goods soon could also indicate that Japan is seeking more favorable trade conditions, which could further boost economic activity. However, the current 15% tariffs that the US is imposing on Japan could be a potential obstacle in the negotiations. The final outcome of these trade talks could have a significant impact on the markets, particularly in sectors involved in US-Japan trade.",

This dip in consumer confidence is concerning as it has fallen to its lowest since October 2023. Additionally, the expectations of unemployment continue to stay high, which could potentially lead to a decrease in consumer spending and a slowdown in the French economy. The opinion on the standard of living has also declined further, with the sub-index for the future standard of living falling another two points to -64, its lowest since March 2023. This indicates a pessimistic outlook on the French economy, as a decrease in consumer confidence and standard of living often precedes an economic downturn.

This is a bearish signal for the banking sector and the Eurozone economy as a whole. Political instability often leads to economic uncertainty, which can negatively affect investor confidence. This can result in capital outflows from the banking sector and a decrease in the market value of banks. The situation is similar to the 2008 financial crisis, where government instability led to a significant decrease in the market value of banks. Given the size and importance of BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, this could have a wider impact on the European banking sector and the Eurozone economy.",

Similar situations have been seen in the past, such as during the Greek debt crisis in 2010, where uncertainty around the government's stability led to a significant drop in the value of Greek banks.

Nasdaq Technical Analysis for Today with tradeCompass,"<p>Nasdaq Futures Technical Analysis for Today with tradeCompass (August 26, 2025)</p><p>Current price (NQ): $23,437 (≈-0.25% vs. yesterday’s close)
Recent context: All-time high on Aug 13 at $24,068.50, a 5-day pullback of -4.32% to $23,035 (near the $23k round number), a 2-day bounce to $23,650 (pivot), and now trading just beneath an important July pivot zone around $23,425–$23,450.</p><p>Summary for Nasdaq 100 Futures Traders Today</p><p>Decision Range: $23,445 – $23,480 (key cluster of levels)
Bearish below: $23,463 (yesterday’s VAL single-price option)
Bullish above: $23,513 (today’s POC)
Primary bias: Bearish while price holds below the Decision Range</p><blockquote><p>Sizing tip: If a 35-point band feels wide, trade the micro contract (MNQ). One MNQ “point” is 1/10th the dollar value of the E-mini, letting you express the same idea with tighter sizing.</p></blockquote><p>Analysis of Nasdaq Futures Today: Market Context & Directional Bias</p><p>Price sits below the $23,445–$23,480 Decision Range, keeping the session tilted bearish unless buyers reclaim the band. For traders who prefer a single trigger, the bearish threshold is $23,463 (below yesterday’s Value Area Low), while bulls need to sustain above $23,513 (today’s Point of Control) to argue for upside continuation toward the upper pivots cited below.</p><p>Partial Profit Targets for Nasdaq Bears Today (once price is below our bearish threshold)</p><p>$23,417 — aligns with the 2nd lower VWAP deviation; frequent intraday magnet when momentum builds.
$23,400 — round-number liquidity pocket where stops often cluster.
$23,374 — nearby acceptance zone that can stall first legs.</p><p>Swing-extension waypoints for bears (if momentum persists):
$23,312 — just above Aug 22 VAH; prior acceptance often retests.
$23,276 — in line with Aug 24 VWAP; fair-value pullback idea.
$23,226 — set above Aug 22 POC to capture reaction risk.
$23,123 — above Aug 22 VAL; deeper test of that value area.</p><blockquote><p>Stop logic for shorts: Your maximum protective stop should not sit beyond the top of the Decision Range ($23,482), because acceptance above that band weakens the short premise. Conservative traders may even key off a 15-min close above $23,513 (today’s POC) as full invalidation.</p></blockquote><p>Partial Profit Targets for Nasdaq Bulls Today (once price sustains above our bullish threshold)</p><p>$23,531 — today’s VWAP; first fair-value magnet overhead.
$23,543 — yesterday’s VAH; typical reaction level after reclaiming POC/VWAP.
$23,575 — set just below Aug 20 VAH to front-run supply.
$23,665 — just below Aug 12 VAL; higher-timeframe inflection.
$23,695 — final swing target in this compass; beyond here awaits a new tradeCompass.</p><blockquote><p>Stop logic for longs: A break back below $23,445 (bottom of the Decision Range) returns price to bearish territory—longs should not persist beneath the opposite bias.</p></blockquote><p>How to Use This Compass</p><ul><li><p>If price probes the Decision Range but fails to hold above it, shorts remain favored.</p></li><li><p>If price accepts above $23,513 (POC), the bull plan activates; use the targets listed and manage risk as below.</p></li><li><p>One trade per direction per tradeCompass.

This is a personal financial decision and does not influence the performance of any public companies or sectors. However, it does reflect the substantial income that top-tier professional athletes can earn, particularly in the NFL. This income allows them to make significant investments in real estate, among other things. This can indirectly support the high-end real estate market, particularly in cities with professional sports teams. However, the overall economic impact of such purchases is minimal, given their relative rarity and the small proportion of total real estate transactions they represent.

Lower interest rates can depress bank earnings by reducing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. This impacts the profitability of financial institutions, thereby affecting the overall performance of the banking and finance sectors. Furthermore, while rate cuts can stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, they are typically implemented in response to signs of economic slowdown. Thus, they can be perceived as a bearish signal for the overall economy. Although rate cuts can lead to a short-term rally in the stock market as investors adjust their expectations, the long-term implications are less certain and potentially negative, hence the negative impact score.",

This surge is expected to have a positive impact on the economy and markets. Tax refunds often lead to increased consumer spending, as consumers have more disposable income. This is particularly beneficial for the consumer discretionary and retail sectors, which often see sales increases as a result. Financial services sector may also benefit as consumers might choose to invest their refunds. Furthermore, an influx of tax refunds can increase market liquidity, as more money is available for investment. This can lead to increased market activity and potentially higher asset prices. However, it's important to note that the impact of a tax refund surge can be influenced by other economic factors, such as inflation rates and consumer confidence. Therefore, while the prediction is positive, it should be considered within the broader economic context.",

When individuals receive large tax refunds, they are more likely to spend that money on goods and services, which can lead to increased sales for businesses, particularly in the retail sector. This increased spending can also lead to higher stock prices for companies in these sectors. Additionally, financial services companies like JPMorgan could also benefit from the surge in tax refunds as individuals may choose to invest some of their refund money. However, it's also important to note that while a surge in tax refunds could stimulate the economy in the short term, it could also lead to inflationary pressures in the long term if the increased spending leads to higher demand for goods and services without a corresponding increase in supply.",

The Trump administration appears to be less inclined towards providing financial support to businesses and universities, which could negatively impact sectors heavily reliant on such funding, including defense and education. Specifically, the mention of Lockheed Martin, a company that derives 97% of its revenue from the government, suggests potential financial implications for defense contractors. The call for lower interest rates could have a positive impact on the finance sector, particularly for businesses and individuals seeking loans. However, the potential for increased scrutiny on mortgage fraud could introduce additional risks for financial institutions. Overall, these policy shifts could lead to a tightening of funds in certain sectors, hence the negative impact rating.",

This could potentially increase interest in financial advisory services but is unlikely to cause substantial shifts in the market. It is also worth noting that the co-CEO's perspective may not necessarily reflect the views of other investors or market participants.",

This suggests that the financial market is optimistic about the potential of this drug to generate significant revenue for the company. The pharmaceutical sector is heavily dependent on the successful development and approval of new drugs. A positive trial result can often lead to a surge in a company's stock price. Given the growing global obesity crisis, a successful obesity treatment could represent a significant market opportunity. This news is therefore likely to have a bullish impact on Eli Lilly's stock. Similar historical events, such as the positive reception of Novo Nordisk's obesity drug, Saxenda, in 2014, support this prediction. However, it's important to note that the ultimate impact will depend on whether the drug gains regulatory approval and how it performs in the market post-launch.",

This could lead to slower economic growth as there would be fewer workers to produce goods and services. In addition, certain sectors such as agriculture, construction, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, and technology, which rely heavily on immigrant labor, could face significant workforce shortages. This could result in increased costs, reduced capacity, and slower growth in these sectors. Furthermore, a stagnant or shrinking workforce could increase fiscal pressures as fewer workers would have to support a growing number of retirees and dependents. While some wage gains may occur due to a tighter labor supply, the broader economy could experience slower and more fragile growth. This makes sustained productivity improvements essential for maintaining economic momentum. Therefore, the overall impact of this news on the markets is bearish.",

Historically, tension between political and monetary policy leaders has led to increased volatility in the stock market, as investors are unsure of the potential impacts on fiscal policy. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia, a major player in the tech sector, could significantly impact that sector, and potentially the broader market. Earnings reports often lead to short-term price swings as investors react to the news. If the report exceeds or falls short of expectations, it could lead to significant market movement.

However, the details of the report suggest a stronger outlook, with AI-driven spending offsetting some of the weakness. This suggests that while the aerospace market may be facing headwinds, the AI technology market continues to show strength. The impact of this news is slightly negative due to the decline in durable goods orders, but the strength in AI spending provides some balance.

Boeing, being a major player in the industry, can significantly influence market trends. However, the details of the situation appear stronger, implying that the overall impact may not be as negative as it initially seems. AI-driven spending, a significant factor in the technology sector, is offsetting the weakness caused by tariff uncertainty. This suggests that the technology sector could experience a bullish impact. Historically, the technology sector has often been a counterbalance in situations of economic uncertainty. However, the ongoing tariff uncertainty could still pose risks to both the aerospace and technology sectors. Therefore, the confidence level of this analysis is medium, as the situation is subject to change based on the resolution of these issues.",

This indicates that while certain sectors like aerospace are facing challenges, others such as technology are showing resilience and even growth. Therefore, while the headline may seem negative, the overall impact on the market is not as severe. It's important to note that Boeing's struggles may have a temporary impact, but the strength in other sectors can provide stability and potential growth opportunities in the market.",

This is mainly because it suggests a level of political instability and potential interference in the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to operate independently of the government. Such interference could lead to uncertainty about the direction of monetary policy, which can be negative for the markets.

However, it's important to note that this could also lead to increased competition and potential pricing wars as other airlines may also see Spirit's instability as an opportunity. The impact on Frontier's bottom line will depend on how effectively it can absorb the additional routes and manage the increased competition.
